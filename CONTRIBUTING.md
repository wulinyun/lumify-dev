Without pull requests from generous people like you, this project
wouldn't be what it is today. You are planning to contribute aren't you?
If so, here's a quick guide to creating a great pull request for
this project:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Run the tests. Pull requests without tests are much less likely to be
merged, and it's great to know you're starting with a clean slate.

3. Add a test for your change. Refactoring and documentation changes
require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug,
please include a test.

4. Make the test pass.

5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on one of the primary developers. This is an
active project so you should get a response in a reasonable amount of time. 
We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives
at that time. Please don't consider the feedback as a lack of
appreciation for your time and effort. It most certainly is not.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted,
are:

* Include good tests
* Keep the changeset small
* Stick to existing code conventions
* Update the documentation, examples elsewhere, guides,
  whatever is affected by your contribution
