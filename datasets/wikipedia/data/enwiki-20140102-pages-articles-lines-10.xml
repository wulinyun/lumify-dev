Lincoln led the United States through its greatest constitutional, military, and moral crisis—the [[American Civil War]]—and in so doing preserved the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], abolished slavery, strengthened the national government and modernized the economy. Reared in a poor family on the [[American frontier|western frontier]], Lincoln was [[Self-education|self-educated]], and became a [[country lawyer]], a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party leader]], [[Illinois House of Representatives|Illinois state legislator]] during the 1830s, and a one-term member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the 1840s.  He promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks, canals, railroads and tariffs to encourage the building of factories; he opposed the war with Mexico in 1846.After a [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|series of highly publicized debates]] in 1858 during which he opposed the expansion of slavery, Lincoln lost the U.S. Senate race in [[Illinois]] to his archrival, [[Stephen A. Douglas]]. Lincoln, a moderate from a [[swing state]], secured the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] presidential nomination in 1860. With almost no support in the [[Southern United States|South]], Lincoln swept the [[Northern United States|North]] and was [[United States presidential election, 1860|elected president in 1860]]. His election prompted seven southern slave states to declare their [[Secession in the United States|secession from the Union]] and form the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The departure of the Democratic politicians to lead the Confederacy gave Lincoln's party firm control of Congress.  The Republican politicians promptly enacted much of [[1860 Republican National Convention#Platform|their party platform]], including a high tariff, free land for colleges in every state ([[Morrill Act of 1862]]), new banking laws, free land for settlers ([[Homestead Act of 1862]]), free land for the [[Pacific Railroad Acts|transcontinental railroad]], and a new [[US Department of Agriculture]]. No formula for compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery. Lincoln explained in his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]]: &quot;Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.&quot;When the North enthusiastically rallied behind the national flag after the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]] on April 12, 1861, Lincoln concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war effort. His goal was to reunite the nation. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', arresting and temporarily detaining thousands of suspected secessionists in the border states without trial. Lincoln averted British recognition of the Confederacy by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' affair]] in late 1861. His numerous complex moves toward ending slavery centered on the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in 1863, using the Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraging the border states to outlaw slavery, and helping push through Congress the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which permanently outlawed slavery. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including commanding general [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Lincoln brought leaders of the major factions of his party into his cabinet and pressured them to cooperate. Lincoln's Navy set up a naval blockade that shut down the South's normal trade, helped take control of Kentucky and Tennessee, and gained control of the Southern river system using gunboats. He tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another until finally Grant succeeded in 1865.An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to &quot;[[War Democrats]]&quot; (who supported the North against the South), and managed his own re-election in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]]. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party, Lincoln found his policies and personality were &quot;blasted from all sides&quot;: [[Radical Republicans]] demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats desired more compromise, [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]] despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists plotted his death.&lt;ref&gt;Tagg, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, Lincoln fought back with patronage, by pitting his opponents against each other, and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory.&lt;ref&gt;Randall (1947), pp. 65–87.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Gettysburg Address]] of 1863 became the most quoted speech in American history.  It was an iconic statement of America's dedication to the principles of nationalism, [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], equal rights, liberty, and democracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulla&quot;&gt;Bulla (2010), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. Six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general [[Robert E. Lee]], however, Lincoln was [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassinated]] by an actor and Confederate sympathizer named [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln's death was the first assassination of a U.S. president and sent the nation into [[Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln|mourning]].

He is descended from [[Samuel Lincoln]], who arrived in [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], Massachusetts, from [[Norfolk]], England, in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake, [[Abraham Lincoln (captain)|Abraham]], had moved his family from Virginia to Kentucky, where he was ambushed and killed in an [[Northwest Indian War|Indian raid]] in 1786, as his children, including Lincoln's father Thomas, looked on.&lt;ref name=&quot;white-12_13&quot;&gt;White, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's mother, Nancy, was the daughter of Lucy Hanks, and was born in what is now [[Mineral County, West Virginia|Mineral County]], West Virginia, then part of Virginia. Lucy moved with Nancy to Kentucky. Nancy Hanks married Thomas, who became a respected citizen. He bought or leased several farms, including [[Knob Creek Farm]]. The family attended a [[Separate Baptists]] church, which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas enjoyed considerable status in Kentucky—where he sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners. By the time his son Abraham was born, Thomas owned two {{convert|600|acre|ha|adj=on}} farms, several town lots, livestock, and horses. He was among the richest men in the county.  However, in 1816, Thomas lost all of his land in court cases because of faulty property titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;sandberg-20&quot;/&gt;[[File:Young Lincoln By Charles Keck.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The young Lincoln in sculpture at Senn Park, Chicago|alt=A statue of young Lincoln sitting on a stump, holding a book open on his lap]]The family [[Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial|moved north across the Ohio River]] to free (i.e., non-slave) territory and made a new start in what was then [[Perry County, Indiana#History|Perry County]] but is now [[Spencer County, Indiana]]. Lincoln later noted that this move was &quot;partly on account of slavery&quot; but mainly due to land title difficulties.&lt;ref name=&quot;sandberg-20&quot;&gt;Sandburg (1926), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In Indiana, when Lincoln was nine, his mother Nancy died of [[milk sickness]] in 1818.  After the death of Lincoln's mother, his older sister, [[Sarah Lincoln Grigsby|Sarah]], took charge of caring for him until their father remarried in 1819; Sarah later died in her 20s while giving birth to a stillborn son.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 20, 30-33.&lt;/ref&gt;Thomas Lincoln's new wife was the widow [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah Bush Johnston]], the mother of three children. Lincoln became very close to his stepmother, and referred to her as &quot;Mother&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; As a pre-teen, he did not like the hard labor associated with frontier life. Some in his family, and in the neighborhood, for a time considered him to be lazy.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 25, 31, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; As he grew into his teens, he willingly took responsibility for all chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household and became an adept axeman in his work building rail fences. He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match to which he was challenged by the renowned leader of a group of ruffians, &quot;the Clary's Grove boys&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln also agreed with the customary obligation of a son to give his father all earnings from work done outside the home until age 21.&lt;ref name=&quot;donald-1996-p30-33&quot;&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Lincoln occasionally loaned his father money.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 28, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln became increasingly distant from his father, in part because of his father's lack of education. While young Lincoln's formal education consisted approximately of a year's worth of classes from several itinerant teachers, he was mostly self-educated and was an avid reader and often sought access to any new books in the village.  He read and reread the ''[[King James Bible]],'' [[Aesop]]'s ''Fables,'' [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]]'s ''Pilgrim's Progress,'' [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]]'s ''Robinson Crusoe,'' and [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]]'s ''Autobiography.''&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;29–31, 38–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merrill D.

It was then that, as an ambitious 22-year-old who was now old enough to make his own decisions, Lincoln struck out on his own. Canoeing down the [[Sangamon River]], Lincoln ended up in the village of [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem]] in [[Sangamon County, Illinois|Sangamon County]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), pp. 23–53&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1831, hired by a New Salem businessman [[Denton Offutt]] and accompanied by friends, he took goods by [[flatboat]] from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon, Illinois, and Mississippi rivers.

Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem. Mary did return in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. She never replied and the courtship ended.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 67–69; Thomas (2008), pp. 56–57, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]], who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; They met in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], Illinois, in December 1839&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandburg4648&quot;&gt;Sandburg (1926), pp. 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt; and were engaged the following December.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln's initiative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandburg4648&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; They later met again at a party and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister.&lt;ref&gt;Sandburg (1926), pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, &quot;To hell, I suppose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;In 1844, the couple bought [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site|a house]] in Springfield near Lincoln's law office. Mary Todd Lincoln kept house, often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] was born in 1843 and [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] (Eddie) in 1846.

[[William Wallace Lincoln|&quot;Willie&quot; Lincoln]] was born on December 21, 1850, and died on February 20, 1862.

Although the economy was booming in the region, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the [[Illinois General Assembly]]. He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural [[raconteur]] in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.&lt;ref&gt;Winkle ch 7–8.{{page needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;Before the election, Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the [[Black Hawk War]].&lt;ref&gt;Winkle, pp. 86–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his return, Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly.

He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' and other law books. Of his learning method, Lincoln stated: &quot;I studied with nobody&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt; His second campaign in 1834 was successful. He won election to the state legislature; though he ran as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Admission to the bar in the United States|Admitted to the bar]] in 1836,&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; he moved to Springfield, Illinois, and began to practice law under [[John T. Stuart]], Mary Todd's cousin.&lt;ref&gt;White, pp. 71, 79, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments. He partnered with [[Stephen T.

He first articulated this in 1837, saying, &quot;[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; He closely followed [[Henry Clay]] in supporting the [[American Colonization Society]] program of making the abolition of slavery practical by helping the freed slaves to settle in [[Liberia]] in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Foner (2010), pp. 17–19, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}==Congressman Lincoln==From the early 1830s, Lincoln was a steadfast [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] and professed to friends in 1861 to be, &quot;an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The party, including Lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, protective tariffs to fund [[internal improvements]] including railroads, and espoused urbanization as well.&lt;ref&gt;Boritt (1994), pp. 137–153.&lt;/ref&gt;In 1846, Lincoln was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line.&lt;ref&gt;Oates, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman [[Joshua R. Giddings]], wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the [[Washington, District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 54; Foner (2010), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke out against the [[Mexican–American War]], which he attributed to [[James K.

Lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the [[Slave Power]].&lt;ref&gt;Zarefsky, pp. 69–110.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln argued, &quot;The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, pp. 299–300.&lt;/ref&gt;After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U.S. Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided Speech]], drawing on {{bible|Mark 3:25}}: &quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand.

Lincoln warned that &quot;[[The Slave Power]]&quot; was threatening the values of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that [[all men are created equal]], while Douglas emphasized his [[Freeport Doctrine]], that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 214–224.&lt;/ref&gt; The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' [[popular sovereignty]] theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the ''Dred Scott'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the ''Illinois Staats-Anzeiger,'' a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 242, 412.&lt;/ref&gt;On February 27, 1860, New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at Cooper Union]] to a group of powerful Republicans. Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery.

Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, pp. 50–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others, while following Lincoln's strong dictate to &quot;Make no contracts that bind me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 247–250.&lt;/ref&gt;Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party, as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the ''Dred Scott'' decision and the presidency of James Buchanan. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.&lt;ref&gt;Boritt (1994), pp. 10, 13, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats. Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the [[1860 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]], disagreeing with Douglas' position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected [[John C. Breckinridge]] as their candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns, Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches. Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of &quot;free labor&quot;, whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 254–256.&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a ''Chicago Tribune'' writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;==Presidency=={{main|Presidency of Abraham Lincoln}}===1860 election and secession==={{Main|United States presidential election, 1860|Baltimore Plot}}{{multiple image| align=right| direction=horizontal| width=| footer=| width1=272| image1=ElectoralCollege1860.svg| alt1=Map of the U.S. showing Lincoln winning the North-east and West, Breckinridge winning the South, Douglas winning Missouri, and Bell winning Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky.| caption1=In 1860, northern and western [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral]] votes (shown in red) put Lincoln into the White House.| width2=148| image2=Abraham lincoln inauguration 1861.jpg| alt2=A large crowd in front of a large building with many pillars.| caption2=1861 inaugural at [[U.S. Capitol Building|Capitol]].

The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the [[Peace Conference of 1861]] signaled that legislative compromise was implausible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 268, 279.&lt;/ref&gt;===Beginning of the war==={{Main|American Civil War|Battle of Fort Sumter}}[[File:Major Robert Anderson.jpg|alt=portrait|thumb|upright|[[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Major Anderson]], Ft. Sumter commander]]The commander of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Major Robert Anderson]], sent a request for provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], forcing them to surrender, and began the war. Historian [[Allan Nevins]] argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union'' (1959) vol 5 p 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was &quot;sadly disappointed&quot; at his failure to realize that &quot;the country was sleeping on a volcano&quot; and that the South was preparing for war.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Donald concludes that, &quot;His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;On April 15, Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and &quot;preserve the Union&quot;, which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. This call forced the states to choose sides. Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital, despite the exposed position of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] so close to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oates, p. 226&quot;&gt;Oates, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;Troops headed south towards Washington to protect the capital in response to Lincoln's call. On April 19, secessionist mobs in Baltimore that controlled the rail links [[Baltimore riot of 1861|attacked Union troops]] traveling to the capital. [[George William Brown]], the Mayor of Baltimore, and other suspected Maryland politicians were arrested and imprisoned, without a warrant, as Lincoln suspended the writ of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States#Suspension during the Civil War|habeas corpus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heidler (2000), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Merryman]], a leader in the secessionist group in Maryland, petitioned Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] to issue a writ of ''habeas corpus,'' saying holding Merryman without a hearing was unlawful. Taney issued the writ, thereby ordering Merryman's release, but Lincoln ignored it. Then and throughout the war, Lincoln came under heavy attack from antiwar Democrats, called [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott, pp. 326–341.&lt;/ref&gt;===Assuming command for the Union in the war===After the fall of [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as [[commander-in-chief]], using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending ''habeas corpus'', arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 303–304; Carwardine (2003), pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:RunningtheMachine-LincAdmin.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A group of men sitting at a table as another man creates money on a wooden machine.|&quot;Running the 'Machine'&amp;nbsp;&quot;: An 1864 political cartoon takes a swing at Lincoln's administration—featuring [[William Fessenden]], [[Edwin Stanton]], [[William H. Seward|William Seward]], [[Gideon Welles]], Lincoln and others.]]The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 315, 331–333, 338–339, 417.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861|Confiscation Act]] that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 314; Carwardine (2003), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;In late August 1861, General [[John C. Frémont]], the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without consulting Washington, a proclamation of [[martial law]] in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be [[court-martial]]ed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the [[Department of the West]] compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 314–317.&lt;/ref&gt; After Lincoln acted, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;The [[Trent Affair]] of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British merchant ship, the ''Trent'', on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFAdams&quot;&gt;Adams, pp. 540–562.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's foreign policy approach had been initially hands off, due to his inexperience; he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward. Seward's initial reaction to the ''Trent'' affair, however, was too bellicose, so Lincoln also turned to Senator [[Charles Sumner]], the chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] and an expert in British diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;To learn technical military terms, Lincoln borrowed and studied [[Henry Halleck]]'s book, ''Elements of Military Art and Science'' from the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Prokopowicz, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the [[United States War Department|War Department]] in Washington, D.C. He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party). In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced [[Simon Cameron]] with [[Edwin Stanton]] as [[United States Secretary of War|War Secretary]]. Stanton was one of many conservative Democrats (he supported Breckenridge in the 1860 election) who became anti-slavery Republicans under Lincoln's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin P. Thomas and Harold M. Hyman, ''Stanton, the Life and Times of Lincoln's Secretary of War'' (Knopf, 1962){{Page needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of war strategy, Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 295–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 391–392.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln learned from his chief of staff General [[Henry Wager Halleck|Henry Halleck]], a student of the European strategist [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jomini]], of the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River;&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, pp. 7, 66, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; he also knew well the importance of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 432–436.&lt;/ref&gt;===General McClellan===After the Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] and the retirement of the aged [[Winfield Scott]] in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General [[George B. McClellan]] general-in-chief of all the Union armies.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 318–319.&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his [[Peninsula Campaign]], longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the [[Army of the Potomac]] by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops in defense of the capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 349–352.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Lincoln and McClellan 1862-10-03.jpg|alt=Photograph of Lincoln and McClellan sitting at a table in a field tent|thumb|Lincoln and McClellan after the Battle of Antietam]]Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief and appointed [[Henry Wager Halleck]] in March 1862, after McClellan's &quot;Harrison's Landing Letter&quot;, in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 360–361.&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], a Republican, as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. However, lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins (1960), pp. 2:159–162.&lt;/ref&gt; The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']], formerly the USS ''Merrimack'', damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']]. Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 339–340.&lt;/ref&gt;Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, pp. 478–479.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after McClellan's return to command, General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s forces crossed the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland, leading to the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, pp. 478–480.&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan then resisted the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General [[Don Carlos Buell]] likewise refused orders to move the [[Army of the Ohio]] against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with [[William Rosecrans]]; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 389–390.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Union soldiers entrenched along the west bank of the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg, Virginia (111-B-157).jpg|thumb|left|Union soldiers before Marye's Heights, [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], just prior to the battle of May 3, 1863]]Burnside, against the advice of the president, prematurely launched an offensive across the [[Rappahannock River]] and was stunningly defeated by Lee at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 429–431.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln brought in [[Joseph Hooker]], despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins 6:433-44&lt;/ref&gt;The [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1862|mid-term elections]] in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of ''habeas corpus,'' [[Conscription|the military draft law]], and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest. While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states, except New York. The Cincinnati ''Gazette'' contended that the voters were &quot;depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins vol 6 pp. 318–322, quote on p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans' on Chattanooga, Grant's on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 422–423.&lt;/ref&gt;Hooker was routed by Lee at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May,&lt;ref&gt;Nevins 6:432–450.&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to do the same in [[Harper's Ferry]], and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by [[George Meade]], who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the [[Gettysburg Campaign]], which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 444–447.&lt;/ref&gt;After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;===Emancipation Proclamation==={{Main|Abraham Lincoln and slavery|Emancipation Proclamation}}[[File:Emancipation proclamation.jpg|thumb|left|Lincoln presents the first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation to his cabinet. Painted by [[Francis Bicknell Carpenter]] in 1864|alt=A dark-haired, bearded, middle-aged man holding documents is seated among seven other men.]]Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At the beginning of the war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept [[compensated emancipation]] in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], under the constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackubin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp|title=The Liberator|first=Thomas Owens|last=Mackubin|date=March 25, 2004|work=National Review|publisher=National Review|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a7fJ9hj|archivedate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General [[John C. Frémont]] in August 1861 and by Major General [[David Hunter]] in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (1999), pp. 290–291.&lt;/ref&gt;On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. In July 1862, the Second [[Confiscation Acts|Confiscation Act]] was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action. In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it, he stated that &quot;as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt;Privately, Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated. However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor [[Horace Greeley]] of the highly influential ''New York Tribune'' fell for the ploy,&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1992), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22, 1862. The President said the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his &quot;official duty&quot;) was preserving the Union:&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (2004), pp. 147–153.&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union&amp;nbsp;... [¶] I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.&lt;ref&gt;Basler (1953), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;}}The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 364, 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.&lt;ref&gt;Louis P. Masur, ''Lincoln's Hundred Days: The Emancipation Proclamation and the War for the Union'' (Harvard University Press; 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization|colonies]] for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the [[War Governors' Conference]]; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins (1960), pp. 2:239–240.&lt;/ref&gt;Enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation.  By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to [[Andrew Johnson]], the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, &quot;The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 430–431.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General [[Lorenzo Thomas]] had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Douglass]] once observed of Lincoln: &quot;In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, pp. 259–260.&lt;/ref&gt;===Gettysburg Address==={{Main|Gettysburg Address}}[[File:Lincolns Gettysburg Address, Gettysburg.JPG|thumb|left|The only confirmed photo of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, some three hours before the speech.]]With the great Union victory at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the [[New York City draft riots]]. The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 453–460.&lt;/ref&gt; Defying Lincoln's prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here,&quot; the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulla&quot;/&gt;In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, &quot;conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal&quot;. He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth&quot;. Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 460–466.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wills, pp. 20, 27, 105, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;===General Grant===[[File:The Peacemakers 1868.jpg|alt=Painting of four men conferring in a ship's cabin, entitled &quot;The Peacemakers&quot;.|thumb|President Lincoln (center right) with, from left, Generals Sherman and Grant and Admiral Porter – [[The Peacemakers|1868 painting]] of events aboard the ''[[River Queen (steamboat)|River Queen]]'' in March 1865]]Meade's failure to capture Lee's army as it retreated from Gettysburg, and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s victories at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and in the [[Vicksburg campaign]] impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, &quot;I can't spare this man. He fights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union'' (Vol. IV), pp. 6–17.&lt;/ref&gt;Nevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congress's consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General, which no officer had held since George Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 490–492.&lt;/ref&gt;Grant waged his bloody [[Overland Campaign]] in 1864. This is often characterized as a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], given high Union losses at battles such as the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had &quot;almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (2009), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, to which the general replied, &quot;I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt;The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army shrank with every costly battle. Grant's army moved south, crossed the [[James River]], forcing a siege and trench warfare outside [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehousehistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html|title=The Peacemakers|publisher=The White House Historical Association|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a8J9jOa|archivedate=2011-10-20|deadurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced the Union losses.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), pp. 422–424.&lt;/ref&gt;Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grant's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and [[Philip Sheridan]] to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia's [[Shenandoah Valley]]. The damage caused by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a {{convert|60|mi|km|adj=on}} swath, but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies. As Neely (2004) concludes, there was no effort to engage in &quot;[[total war]]&quot; against civilians, as in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Neely (2004), pp. 434–458.&lt;/ref&gt;Confederate general [[Jubal Anderson Early]] began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital. During Early's [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raid on Washington, D.C.]] in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] shouted at him, &quot;Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 516–518.&lt;/ref&gt;As Grant continued to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President [[Alexander H. Stephens|Stephens]] led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at [[Hampton Roads]]. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the [[Battle of Five Forks]] and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but [[freedmen]] greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]] and the war was effectively over.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;===1864 re-election==={{Main|Electoral history of Abraham Lincoln|United States presidential election, 1864}}Lincoln was a master politician, bringing together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party, and bringing in [[War Democrats]] such as [[Edwin M. Stanton]] and [[Andrew Johnson]] as well. Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Fish, pp. 53–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tegeder, pp. 77–90.&lt;/ref&gt; At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected [[Andrew Johnson]], a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new [[National Union Party (United States)|Union Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 494–507.&lt;/ref&gt;When Grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted, the lack of military success wore heavily on the President's re-election prospects, and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Sharing this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:&lt;ref&gt;Grimsley, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Basler (1953), p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.{{multiple image| align=left| direction=horizontal| width=| footer=| width1=272| image1=1864 Electoral Map.png| alt1=Map of the U.S. showing Lincoln winning all the Union states except for Kentucky, New Jersey, and Delaware.

Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and [[David Farragut]]'s capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters;&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. By contrast, the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the [[perfidy]] of the Copperheads.&lt;ref&gt;Randall &amp; Current (1955), p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide, carrying all but three states, and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers' vote.&lt;ref&gt;Paludan, pp. 274–293.&lt;/ref&gt;On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]]. In it, he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God's will. Historian [[Mark Noll]] concludes it ranks &quot;among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Noll, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln said:{{quote|Fondly do we hope—fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the [[wikt:bondman|bond-man's]] 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still it must be said, &quot;the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether&quot;. With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Lincoln, ''Abraham Lincoln: Selected Speeches and Writings'' (Library of America edition, 2009) p 450&lt;/ref&gt;}}===Reconstruction==={{Main|Reconstruction Era}}Reconstruction began during the war, as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states, and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. Shortly after Lee's surrender, a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, and Lincoln replied, &quot;Let 'em up easy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (2008), pp. 509–512.&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with that sentiment, Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep. [[Thaddeus Stevens]], Sen. [[Charles Sumner]] and Sen. [[Benjamin Wade]], political allies of the president on other issues. Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 471–472.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|alt=Cartoon of Lincoln and Johnson attempting to stitch up the broken Union|thumb|A political cartoon of Andrew Johnson and Abraham Lincoln, 1865, entitled &quot;The 'Rail Splitter' At Work Repairing the Union.&quot; The caption reads (Johnson): ''Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever.'' (Lincoln): ''A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended.'']]As Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Frederick Steele]] as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the [[Wade-Davis Bill]], in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 485–486.&lt;/ref&gt;Lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the choice of the Radicals, [[Salmon P. Chase]], who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union'', Vol IV., p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, which did not apply to every state, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment. Lincoln declared that such an amendment would &quot;clinch the whole matter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1863, a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage. This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives. Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864. After a long debate in the House, a second attempt passed Congress on January 31, 1865, and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 562–563.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/house-passes-the-13th-amendment |title=House passes the 13th Amendment — History.com This Day in History — 1/31/1865 |publisher=History.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon ratification, it became the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary Documents in American History: 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html|publisher=Library of Congress|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a9BIwNw|archivedate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;As the war drew to a close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of [[freedmen]]. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's [[Freedmen's Bureau]] bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine (2003), pp. 242–243.&lt;/ref&gt;===Redefining the republic and republicanism===[[File:Abraham Lincoln O-116 by Gardner, 1865-crop.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=An older tired looking Lincoln with a beard.|Lincoln in February 1865, about two months before his death.]]The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. The term &quot;the United States&quot; has historically been used, sometimes in the plural (&quot;these United States&quot;), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Presidential Proclamation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/12/presidential-proclamation-civil-war-sesquicentennial|title=Presidential Proclamation-Civil War Sesquicentennial|publisher=The White House|date=April 12, 2011|quote=...&amp;nbsp;a new meaning was conferred on our country's name&amp;nbsp;... |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62aAPoA6B|archivedate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;In recent years, historians such as Harry Jaffa, Herman Belz, John Diggins, Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln's redefinition of [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the &quot;sheet anchor&quot; of republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, &quot;Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Diggins, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.&lt;ref&gt;Foner (2010), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.&lt;ref&gt;Orville Vernon Burton, ''The Age of Lincoln'' (2008) p 243&lt;/ref&gt;In March 1861, in his [[Lincoln's first inaugural address|First Inaugural Address]], Lincoln explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system. He said &quot;A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Belz (1998), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}===Other enactments===Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (2001), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; He signed the [[Homestead Act]] in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which was completed in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Paludan, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1993), pp. 450–452.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Infobox U.S. Cabinet| Name = Lincoln| President = Abraham Lincoln| President date = 1861–1865| Vice President = [[Hannibal Hamlin]]| Vice President date = 1861–1865| Vice President 2 = [[Andrew Johnson]]| Vice President date 2 = 1865| State = [[William H.

In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third [[Morrill Tariff]], the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Revenue Act of 1861]], creating the first U.S. income tax.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|800|1861|r=-2}}}} in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the [[Revenue Act of 1862]] to a progressive rate structure.&lt;ref&gt;Paludan, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas. The creation of the system of national banks by the [[National Banking Act]] provided a strong financial network in the country. It also established a national currency.

Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted [[Sioux#Santee (Isáŋyathi or Eastern Dakota)|Santee Dakota]] who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved).&lt;ref&gt;Cox, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, pp. 210–232.&lt;/ref&gt;In the wake of Grant's casualties in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, but it was never issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the ''[[New York World]]'' and the ''[[The Journal of Commerce|Journal of Commerce]]'' published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), pp. 501–502.&lt;/ref&gt;Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving holiday]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 1996, p. 471&quot;&gt;Donald (1996), p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt; Before Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates.

Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, [[Salmon P. Chase]], was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Blue, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;====Other judicial appointments====Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges, including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], and 27 judges to the [[United States district courts]].

Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1. Lincoln; 2. George Washington; and 3. Franklin D. Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, occasionally are reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Densen, John V., Editor, ''Reassessing The Presidency, The Rise of the Executive State and the Decline of Freedom'' (Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2001), pgs. 1–32; Ridings, William H., &amp; Stuard B.

Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party.

The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] on the Mall in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (2000), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Deal]] era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state. In the [[Cold War]] years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (2009), pp. 23, 91–98.&lt;/ref&gt;By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to [[Conservatism in the United States|political conservatives]]&lt;ref&gt;Havers, p. 96.

Harris found that Lincoln's &quot;reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation &quot;in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform&quot;. Randall concludes that, &quot;he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Randall (1947), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;By the late 1960s, liberals, such as historian [[Lerone Bennett, Jr.|Lerone Bennett]], were having second thoughts, especially regarding Lincoln's views on racial issues.&lt;ref&gt;Zilversmit, pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, pp. 35–42.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs, told jokes that ridiculed blacks, insisted he opposed social equality, and proposed [[American Colonization Society|sending freed slaves]] to another country. Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day;&lt;ref&gt;Dirck (2008), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was a &quot;moral visionary&quot; who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible.&lt;ref&gt;Striner, pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Cashin, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelley &amp; Lewis, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered &quot;erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule&quot; in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz (2009), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of [[negative capability]], defined by the poet [[John Keats]] and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were &quot;content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald (1996), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;Lincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood, almost always in a flattering light.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Spielberg, Doris Kearns Goodwin,  and Tony Kushner, &quot;Mr. Lincoln Goes to Hollywood&quot;, ''Smithsonian'' (2012) 43#7 pp. 46–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Stokes, &quot;Abraham Lincoln and the Movies&quot;, ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 12 (June 2011), 203–31.&lt;/ref&gt;==Memorials=={{Main|Memorials to Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln cultural depictions}}[[File:Aerial view of Lincoln Memorial - east side EDIT.jpeg|thumb|alt=An aerial photo a large white building with big pillars.|[[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C.]][[File:Wheres George 5 Dollar Bill.png|thumb|[[Where's George?]] marked [[United States five-dollar bill]] featuring Abraham Lincoln's portrait]]Lincoln's portrait appears on two denominations of [[United States currency]], the [[Penny (United States coin)|penny]] and the [[United States five-dollar bill|$5 bill]].

At the age of eighteen, he joined [[Plato's Academy|Plato’s Academy]] in [[Athens]] and remained until the age of thirty-seven, around 347 BCE.  His writings cover many subjects, including [[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]], [[metaphysics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], [[Theatre|theater]], [[music]], [[logic]], [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], [[politics]], [[government]], [[ethics]], [[biology]], and [[zoology]]. Aristotle's writings were the first to create a comprehensive system of [[Western philosophy]], encompassing [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], [[logic]], science, politics, and [[metaphysics]]. Shortly after Plato died Aristotle left Athens. With the request of [[Philip of Macedonia]] he became a tutor for Alexander in 356–323 BCE. According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], “Aristotle was the first genuine [[scientist]] in history. . . . Every scientist is in his debt.”Aristotle achieved merit through teaching [[Alexander the Great]]. This distinction allowed him many opportunities, including an abundance of supplies. He established a library in the [[Lyceum]] which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of [[Platonism]], but following Plato’s death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism .{{sfn|Barnes|2007|p=6}} He believed all peoples' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception. Aristotle’s views on [[Natural Science|natural sciences]], including philosophy of the mind, body, sensory experience, memory, and biology represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.Aristotle's views on the [[Aristotelian physics|physical sciences]] profoundly shaped medieval scholarship, and their influence extended well into the [[Renaissance]], although they were ultimately replaced by [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]. In the zoological sciences, some of his observations were confirmed to be accurate only in the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern [[formal logic]].In metaphysics, [[Aristotelianism]] had a profound influence on [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)|philosophical and theological thinking in the Islamic and Jewish traditions]] in the [[Middle Ages]], and it continues to influence [[Christian theology]], especially the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the Catholic Church. Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as 'المعلم الأول' – &quot;The First Teacher&quot;.His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]]. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues ([[Cicero]] described his literary style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Cicero| first =Marcus Tullius| coauthors =| title =flumen orationis aureum fundens Aristoteles| work =Academica| publisher =| date =106 BC – 43 BC| url =http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/gutenberg/1/4/9/7/14970/14970-h/14970-h.htm#BkII_119| doi =| accessdate =25 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is thought that the majority of his writings are now lost and only about one-third of the original works have survived.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Barnes]], &quot;Life and Work&quot; in ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'' (1995), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;==Life==Aristotle, whose name means &quot;the best purpose,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=Michael|title=Behind the Name: Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Aristotle|url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/aristotle|work=Behind the Name: The Etymology and History of First Names|publisher=www.behindthename.com|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]], [[Chalcidice]], in 384 BC, about {{convert|55|km|0|abbr=on}} east of modern-day [[Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Aristotle: The Great Philosophers | author = McLeisch, Kenneth Cole| publisher = Routledge | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-415-92392-1 | page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]] was the personal physician to [[Amyntas III of Macedon|King Amyntas of Macedon]].  Although there is little information on Aristotle's childhood, he probably did spend some time in the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Anagnostopoulos, G., &quot;Aristotle's Life&quot;, ''A Companion to Aristotle'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2009), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;At about the age of eighteen, he went to [[Athens]] to continue his education at [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]]. Aristotle remained at the academy for nearly twenty years before leaving Athens in 348/47 BC. The traditional story about his departure reports that he was disappointed with the direction the academy took after control passed to Plato's nephew [[Speusippus]] upon his death, although it is possible that he feared anti-Macedonian sentiments and left before Plato had died.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lord Intro&quot;&gt;Carnes Lord, Introduction to ''The Politics'', by Aristotle (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; The compatibility of Aristotle and Plato has been a strongly debated topic. Recently, [[Harold Cherniss]] summarized Aristotle's Platonism from the standpoint of Jaeger stating that, &quot;Werner Jaeger, in whose eyes Plato's philosophy was the 'matter' out of which the newer and higher form of Aristotle's thought proceeded by a gradual but steady and undeviating development (''Aristotles'', p. 11), pronounced the 'old controversy,' whether or not Aristotle understood Plato, to be 'absolut verstandnislos.' Yet this did not prevent Leisegang from reasserting that Aristotle's own pattern of thinking was incompatible with a proper understanding of Plato.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cherniss, Harold (1962). ''Aristotle's Criticism of Plato and the Academy,&quot; Russell and Russell, Inc., p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Aristoteles: Grundlegung einer Geschichte seiner Entwicklung'' (1923; English trans. by Richard Robinson (1902-1996) as ''Aristotle: Fundamentals of the History of His Development'', 1934).&lt;/ref&gt; Jaeger was sympathetic to the compatible reading of Aristotle and Plato, and was contrary to Leisegang's opinion. Leisegang was unsympathetic to acknowledging any compatibility between Aristotle and Plato.He then traveled with [[Xenocrates]] to the court of his friend [[Hermias of Atarneus]] in Asia Minor. While in Asia, Aristotle traveled with [[Theophrastus]] to the island of [[Lesbos]], where together they researched the [[botany]] and zoology of the island. Aristotle married Hermias's adoptive daughter (or niece) [[Pythias]]. She bore him a daughter, whom they named Pythias. Soon after Hermias' death, Aristotle was invited by [[Philip II of Macedon]] to become the tutor to his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] in 343 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;&gt;Bertrand Russell, &quot;A History of Western Philosophy&quot;, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Arabic aristotle.jpg|thumb|An early Islamic portrayal of Aristotle (r) and [[Alexander the Great]] (l).]]Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of [[Macedon]].

Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years.

According to the [[Suda]], he also had an [[eromenos]], [[Palaephatus|Palaephatus of Abydus]].&lt;ref&gt;William George Smith,''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. 3, [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2421.html p. 88]&lt;/ref&gt;It is during this period in Athens from 335 to 323 BC when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;/&gt; Aristotle wrote many dialogues, only fragments of which survived. The works that have survived are in [[treatise]] form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication, as they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[De Anima]] (On the Soul)'' and ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them. In physical science, Aristotle studied anatomy, astronomy, [[embryology]], geography, geology, meteorology, physics and zoology. In philosophy, he wrote on aesthetics, ethics, government, metaphysics, politics, economics, psychology, rhetoric and theology. He also studied education, foreign customs, literature and poetry. His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge. It has been suggested that Aristotle was probably the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Neill| first =Alex| coauthors =Aaron Ridley| title =The Philosophy of Art: Readings Ancient and Modern| publisher =McGraw Hill| year =1995| page =488| url =http://www.amazon.com/dp/0070461929/}}&lt;/ref&gt;Near the end of Alexander's life, Alexander began to suspect plots against himself, and threatened Aristotle in letters.

Aristotle believed an “imprint” becomes impressed on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] is too complex that the nervous system (semi-fluid bodily organ) cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of [[sense|sensation]], [[common sense]], and [[thinking]] .{{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=61}} The mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception. It does not matter if the experience was seen or heard, every experience ends up as a mental image in memory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carruthers |first=Mary |url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=dntrAnqfIasC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=The+book+of+memory:+the+study+of+memory+in+medieval+times&amp;ots=we1jd9n54J&amp;sig=Lr9XAjRR9tiUyA0rCgI04VzEuKo#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20book%20of%20memory%3A%20the%20study%20of%20memory%20in%20medieval%20times&amp;f=false |title=The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture |year=2007 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;Aristotle uses the word “memory” for two basic abilities. First, the actual retaining of the experience in the  [[mnemonic]] “imprint” that can develop from sensation. Second, the intellectual anxiety that comes with the “imprint” due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents. These abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time. Therefore, memory is of the past, {{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=25}} prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. The retrieval of our “imprints” cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.Aristotle proposed that slow-witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the “imprint” can easily continue. However, they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new “imprints”. He believed the young and the old do not properly develop an “imprint”. Young people undergo rapid changes as they develop, while the elderly’s organs are beginning to decay, thus stunting new “imprints”. Likewise, people who are too quick-witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ. Since intellectual functions are not involved in memory, memories belong to some animals too, but only those in which have [[perception]] of time.===Recollection===Since Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or “imprints”, people are continually weaving together new “imprints” of things they experience. In order to search for these “imprints”, people search the memory itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warren |first=Howard |url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=D4IXAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=The+history+of+the+association+of+psychology&amp;ots=YfWh-rerz2&amp;sig=1U6rgT1pNbwy18xC50m9kopXVXw#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20history%20of%20the%20association%20of%20psychology&amp;f=false |title=A History of the Association Psychology |year=1921 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the memory, if one [[experience]] is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. [[Recall (memory)|Recollection]] occurs when one experience naturally follows another. If the chain of &quot;images&quot; is needed, one memory will stimulate the other. If the chain of &quot;images&quot; is not needed, but expected, then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed .{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=25}}Recollection is the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory &quot;imprint&quot; after some time has passed. Retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being ([[human]] or [[animal]]) and the abilities the human or animal possesses .{{sfn|Carruthers|2007|p=19}} Only humans will remember &quot;imprints&quot; of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed. Recollection of an &quot;imprint&quot; is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences. When an &quot;imprint&quot; is recalled, it may bring forth a large group of related &quot;imprints&quot; .{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=296}}Aristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain “imprints”, was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships: similarity, contrast, and contiguity. These three laws make up his [[Laws of Association]]. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled .{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=259}}==Thought=====Logic===[[File:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|thumb|upright|Aristotle portrayed in the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' as a scholar of the 15th century A.D.]]{{Main|Term logic}}{{details|Non-Aristotelian logic}}With the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic,&lt;ref&gt;MICHAEL DEGNAN, 1994.

Logic seems to have emerged from [[dialectics]]; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a [[deductive system]], he could never actually construct one, thus he relied instead on his [[dialectic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bocheński, 1951&quot;&gt;Bocheński, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from [[premise]]s, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the [[Logical consequence|conclusion]] would logically follow. Consequently, Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial. He never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', where he introduced his division method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Rose| first =Lynn E.| title =Aristotle's Syllogistic| publisher =Charles C Thomas Publisher| year =1968| location =Springfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;====Analytics and the ''Organon''===={{Main|Organon}}What we today call ''Aristotelian logic'', Aristotle himself would have labeled &quot;analytics&quot;. The term &quot;logic&quot; he reserved to mean ''dialectics''. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century AD:#''Categories''#''On Interpretation''#''Prior Analytics''#''Posterior Analytics''#''Topics''#''On Sophistical Refutations''The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the ''Categories,'' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in ''On Interpretation'', to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the ''Analytics'') and dialectics (in the ''Topics'' and ''Sophistical Refutations''). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory ''stricto sensu'': the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the ''Organon'', namely the fourth book of ''Metaphysics.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Bocheński, 1951&quot;/&gt;===Aristotle's epistemology===[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]''&lt;!-- this should link to an article about the famous artwork --&gt;, a fresco by [[Raphael]]. Aristotle gestures to the earth, representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience, while holding a copy of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' in his hand, whilst Plato gestures to the heavens, representing his belief in [[The Forms]].]]{{details|Aristotle's theory of universals}}[[File:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|&quot;Aristotle&quot; by Francesco Hayez (1791–1882)]]Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]]. Aristotle's [[ontology]], however, finds the universal in [[particular]] things, which he calls the essence of things, while in Plato's ontology, the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their [[prototype]] or [[exemplar]]. For Aristotle, therefore, [[epistemology]] is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these. For Aristotle, &quot;form&quot; still refers to the unconditional basis of [[phenomena]] but is &quot;instantiated&quot; in a particular substance (see ''[[Aristotle#Universals and particulars|Universals and particulars]]'', below). In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], while Plato's is essentially deductive from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Jori| first =Alberto| title =Aristotele| publisher =Bruno Mondadori Editore| year =2003| location =Milano}}&lt;/ref&gt;In Aristotle's terminology, &quot;natural philosophy&quot; is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. In modern times, the scope of ''philosophy'' has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the [[scientific method]]. In contrast, Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.In the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as &quot;science&quot;. Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term &quot;scientific method&quot;. For Aristotle, &quot;all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical&quot; (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25). By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, [[mathematics]] and metaphysics.If logic (or &quot;analytics&quot;) is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) [[Logic]]; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics and Mathematics; (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy.In the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. He did, however, perform [[original research]] in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences.Aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. Beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.His writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. For example, in his ''[[History of Animals]]'' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''History of Animals'', 2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, [[John Philoponus]], and later [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.2 |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Aristotle refuted [[Democritus]]'s claim that the [[Milky Way]] was made up of &quot;those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays,&quot; pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given &quot;current astronomical demonstrations&quot; that &quot;the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then&amp;nbsp;... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Meteorology'' 1.8, trans. E.W. Webster, rev. J. Barnes.&lt;/ref&gt;In places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving 'laws of the universe' from simple observation and over-stretched [[reason]]. Today's scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws.Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots. He posited a [[geocentrism|geocentric cosmology]] that we may discern in selections of the ''Metaphysics'', which was widely accepted up until the 16th century. From the 3rd century to the 16th century, the dominant view held that the Earth was the rotational [[History of the Center of the Universe|center of the universe]].Since he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnet (classicist)|Burent, John.]] 1928. ''Platonism'', Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 61, 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.===Geology===As quoted from [[w:Charles Lyell|Charles Lyell's]] ''[[Principles of Geology]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He [Aristotle] refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages. He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized. He points to the growth of the Nilotic delta since the time of Homer, to the shallowing of the [[Palus Maeotis]] within sixty years from his own time&amp;nbsp;... He alludes&amp;nbsp;... to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption. The changes of the earth, he says, are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives, that they are overlooked; and the migrations of people after great catastrophes, and their removal to other regions, cause the event to be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says [12th chapter of his ''Meteorics''] 'the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time, but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land, and again it becomes land where it was sea, and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system, and within a certain period.' The concluding observation is as follows: 'As time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the Tanais, nor the Nile, can have flowed for ever. The places where they rise were once dry, and there is a limit to their operations, but there is none to time. So also of all other rivers; they spring up and they perish; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others The same tracts, therefore, of the earth are not some always sea, and others always continents, but every thing changes in the course of time.'&lt;ref&gt;[[wikiquote:Charles Lyell|Charles Lyell]], ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=mmIOAAAAQAAJ&amp; Principles of Geology]'', 1832, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;===Physics==={{Main|Physics (Aristotle)}}====Five elements===={{Main|Classical element}}Aristotle proposed a fifth element, aether, in addition to the four proposed earlier by [[Empedocles]].*[[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], which is cold and dry; this corresponds to the modern idea of a solid.*[[Water (classical element)|Water]], which is cold and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a liquid.*[[Air (classical element)|Air]], which is hot and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a gas.*[[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], which is hot and dry; this corresponds to the modern ideas of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[heat]].*[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]], which is the divine substance that makes up the [[Celestial spheres|heavenly spheres]] and heavenly bodies (stars and planets).Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place. All that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe, i.e., the center of the Earth. Water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center. Air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere. Fire tends toward the lunar sphere (in which the Moon orbits). When elements are moved out of their natural place, they naturally move back towards it. This is &quot;natural motion&quot;—motion requiring no extrinsic cause. So, for example, in water, earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up; in air, rain falls and flame rises.  Outside all the other spheres, the heavenly, fifth element, manifested in the stars and planets, moves in the perfection of circles.====Motion===={{Main|potentiality and actuality}}Aristotle defined [[Motion (physics)|motion]] as the actuality of a potentiality ''as such''.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 201a10–11, 201a27–29, 201b4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally; that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential, as a transition toward a potentially possible state. Because [[Aristotle#Substance, potentiality and actuality|actuality and potentiality]] are normally opposites in Aristotle, other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous, or that the addition of the &quot;as such&quot; to the definition is critical to understanding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sachs|first=Joe|title=Aristotle: Motion and its Place in Nature|year=2005|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-mot/|journal=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;====Causality, the four causes====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Retrocausality]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;{{Main|Four causes}}Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active causal factors:*[[Material cause]] describes the material out of which something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel. It is not about action. It does not mean one domino knocks over another domino.*The [[formal cause]] is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter.  It tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create his drawings.*The [[efficient cause]] is &quot;the primary source&quot;, or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of &quot;cause&quot; as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. So, take the two dominoes, this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over.*The [[final cause]] is its purpose, or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or teleos is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition, need, desire, ethics, or spiritual beliefs.Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect). Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event. Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino, since it cannot fall of its own accord.Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.====Optics====Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day. The earliest known written evidence of a [[camera obscura]] can be found in Aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350 BC in ''Problemata''. Aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or [[aperture]], to allow for sunlight to enter. Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object. In modern cameras, this is analogous to the [[Diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]]. Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased, the image was magnified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Lahanas |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Optics.htm |title=Optics and ancient Greeks |publisher=Mlahanas.de |date= |accessdate=26 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090411051535/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Optics.htm| archivedate= 11 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;====Chance and spontaneity====According to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of [[sumbebekos|accidental things]]. It is &quot;from what is spontaneous&quot; (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of &quot;chance&quot; it might be better to think of &quot;coincidence&quot;: Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place.For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.There is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names &quot;luck&quot;, that can only apply to human beings, since it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. &quot;What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 2.6&lt;/ref&gt;===Metaphysics===[[File:Uni Freiburg - Philosophen 4.jpg|thumb|Statue of Aristotle (1915) by Cipri Adolf Bermann at the [[University of Freiburg]] [[Freiburg im Breisgau|im Breisgau]]]]{{Main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}Aristotle defines metaphysics as &quot;the knowledge of [[hylomorphism|immaterial]] being,&quot; or of &quot;being in the highest degree of [[abstraction]].&quot; He refers to metaphysics as &quot;first philosophy&quot;, as well as &quot;the theologic science.&quot;====Substance, potentiality and actuality===={{See also|Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)}}Aristotle examines the concepts of [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[essence]] (''ousia'') in his ''Metaphysics'' (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form. In book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the [[Material substratum|substratum]], or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house, while the form of the substance is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] (see also [[predicables]]) that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1043a 10–30&lt;/ref&gt;With regard to the change (''[[Potentiality and actuality|kinesis]]'') and its causes now, as he defines in his [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]] and [[On Generation and Corruption]] 319b–320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:# growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;# locomotion, which is change in space; and# alteration, which is change in quality.The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form.Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein''), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate&amp;nbsp;– being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise&amp;nbsp;– acting).Actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' IX 1050a 5–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a [[final cause]] or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality.With this [[definition]] of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, &quot;what is it that makes a man one&quot;? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1045a–b&lt;/ref&gt;====Universals and particulars===={{Main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but &quot;good&quot; is still a proper universal form. [[Bertrand Russell]] is a 20th-century philosopher who agreed with Plato on the existence of &quot;uninstantiated universals&quot;.Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.===Biology and medicine===In Aristotelian science, especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition. He dissected animals but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.====Empirical research program====[[File:Octopus3.jpg|thumb|Octopus swimming]][[File:Torpedo fuscomaculata2.jpg|thumb|''Torpedo fuscomaculata'']][[File:Triakis semifasciata.jpg|thumb|Leopard shark]]Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of [[Lesbos]], and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. The works that reflect this research, such as ''[[History of Animals]]'', ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', and ''[[Parts of Animals]]'', contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on [[catfish]], [[Electric ray|electric fish]] (''[[Torpedo (genus)|Torpedo]]'') and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on [[cephalopod]]s, namely, ''[[Octopus]]'', ''Sepia'' ([[cuttlefish]]) and the paper nautilus (''[[Argonauta argo]]''). His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]], used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē ([[selachians]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, Charles 1931&quot;&gt;Singer, Charles. ''A short history of biology''. Oxford 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;Another good example of his methods comes from the ''Generation of Animals'' in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated.He gave accurate descriptions of [[ruminant]]s' four-chambered fore-stomachs, and of the [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] embryological development of the [[hound shark]] ''[[Mustelus mustelus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Kearns, &quot;Animals, knowledge about,&quot; in ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 3rd ed., 1996, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;====Classification of living things====Aristotle's classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the 19th century. What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood' (he did not know that complex invertebrates do make use of [[hemoglobin]], but of a different kind from vertebrates). Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (humans and mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs). In some respects, this incomplete classification is better than that of [[Linnaeus]], who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups, Insecta and Vermes (worms).For [[Charles Singer]], &quot;Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a ''scala naturae''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, Charles 1931&quot;/&gt; Aristotle's ''History of Animals'' classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical &quot;[[Great chain of being|Ladder of Life]]&quot; (''scala naturae''  or [[Great Chain of Being]]), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, of course, is not responsible for the later use made of this idea by clerics.&lt;/ref&gt;Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e., [[final cause]]s, guided all natural processes. Such a [[teleological]] view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. Noting that &quot;no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns,&quot; and &quot;a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen,&quot; Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. Noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the ''scala naturae''.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 201–202; see also: Lovejoy, ''The Great Chain of Being''&lt;/ref&gt; His system had eleven grades, arranged according &quot;to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality&quot;, expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs.Aristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.He placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''De Anima'' II 3&lt;/ref&gt;Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 45&lt;/ref&gt; Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, ''A History of Greek Philosophy'' Vol. 1 pp. 348&lt;/ref&gt;====Successor: Theophrastus====[[File:161Theophrastus 161 frontespizio.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] to a 1644 version of the expanded and illustrated edition of ''[[Historia Plantarum]]'' (ca. 1200), which was originally written around 200 BC.]]{{Main|Theophrastus|Historia Plantarum}}Aristotle's successor at the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on botany—the ''History of Plants''—which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the [[Middle Ages]]. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as ''carpos'' for fruit, and ''pericarpion'' for seed vessel.Rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's concept of the [[efficient cause]]. Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90–91; Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'', p 46&lt;/ref&gt;====Influence on Hellenistic medicine===={{details|Medicine in ancient Greece}}After Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref&gt;Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'' pp 252&lt;/ref&gt; It is not until the age of [[Alexandria]] under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] that advances in biology can be again found.The first medical teacher at Alexandria, [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]], corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 56&lt;/ref&gt; Though a few ancient [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[Lucretius]] challenged the [[teleology|teleological]] viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, [[natural theology]]) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Ernst Mayr]] claimed that there was &quot;nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90–94; quotation from p 91&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref&gt;Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'', p 252&lt;/ref&gt;===Psychology===Aristotle's [[psychology]], given in his treatise [[On the Soul]] (''peri psyche'', often known by its [[Latin]] title ''De Anima''), posits three kinds of [[soul]] (&quot;psyches&quot;): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have a rational soul. This kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them.For Aristotle, the soul (''psyche'') was a simpler concept than it is for us today. By soul he simply meant the [[Hylomorphism#Body–soul hylomorphism|form]] of a living being. Since all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement).&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, article [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-psychology/ &quot;Psychology&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;===Practical philosophy=======Ethics===={{Main|Aristotelian ethics}}Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (''ergon'') of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the ''[[De Anima|psuchē]]'' (normally translated as ''soul'') in accordance with reason (''[[logos]]''). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, ''[[eudaimonia]]'', generally translated as &quot;happiness&quot; or sometimes &quot;well being&quot;. To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (''ēthikē'' ''[[aretē]]''), often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence).&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book I. See for example chapter 7 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1098a 1098a].&lt;/ref&gt;Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (''[[phronesis]]'') and their intellect (''[[nous]]'') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished [[theory|theoretical]] or speculative thinker, or in other words, a [[philosophy|philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book VI.&lt;/ref&gt;====Politics===={{Main|Politics (Aristotle)}}{{quote|''Like Aristotle, conservatives generally accept the world as it is; they distrust the politics of abstract reason – that is, reason divorced from experience.''&lt;br&gt;'''''Benjamin Wiker'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnd.com/2010/08/191121 |title=Aristotle: Father of political conservatism |publisher=Wnd.com |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, &quot;for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Politics 1253a19–24&lt;/ref&gt; He also famously stated that &quot;man is by nature a political animal&quot;. Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an [[organism]] rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Ebenstein | first =Alan | coauthors =William Ebenstein | title =Introduction to Political Thinkers | publisher =Wadsworth Group | year =2002 | page =59}}&lt;/ref&gt;The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different to Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (''[[polis]]'') which functions as a political &quot;community&quot; or &quot;partnership&quot; (''koinōnia'')&lt;!-- (1252a1) --&gt;. The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability&lt;!-- (1280b29–31) --&gt;, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: &quot;The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together&lt;!-- (1281a1–3) --&gt;.&quot; This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with [[social contract]] theory, according to which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of &quot;fear of violent death&quot; or its &quot;inconveniences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For a different reading of social and economic processes in the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and ''Politics'' see Polanyi, K. (1957) &quot;Aristotle Discovers the Economy&quot; in ''Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies: Essays of Karl Polanyi'' ed. G. Dalton, Boston 1971, 78–115&lt;/ref&gt;====Rhetoric and poetics===={{Main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Poetics (Aristotle)}}Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|imitative]], each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;While it is believed that Aristotle's ''Poetics'' comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' VI&lt;/ref&gt; The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic [[mimesis]]. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' XXVI&lt;/ref&gt;Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of [[Aesop]].&lt;ref&gt;Temple, Olivia, and Temple, Robert (translators), [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZB-rVxPvtPEC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_0 The Complete Fables By Aesop] Penguin Classics, 1998.

Others, such as ''On Colors,'' may have been produced by Aristotle's successors at the Lyceum, e.g., [[Theophrastus]] and [[Strato of Lampsacus|Straton]]. Still others acquired Aristotle's name through similarities in doctrine or content, such as the ''De Plantis,'' possibly by [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]. Other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and [[astrological]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] texts whose connections to Aristotle are purely fanciful and self-promotional.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Thorndike, &quot;Chiromancy in Medieval Latin Manuscripts,&quot; ''Speculum'' 40 (1965), pp. 674–706; Roger A.

Aristotle himself never uses the term &quot;esoteric&quot; or &quot;acroamatic&quot;. For other passages where Aristotle speaks of ''exōterikoi logoi'', see [[W. D. Ross]], ''Aristotle's Metaphysics'' (1953), vol. 2, pp. 408–410. Ross defends an interpretation according to which the phrase, at least in Aristotle's own works, usually refers generally to &quot;discussions not peculiar to the [[Peripatetic school]]&quot;, rather than to specific works of Aristotle's own.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works intended for use within the school (esoteric). Modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be Aristotle's own (unpolished) lecture notes (or in some cases possible notes by his students).&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, Life and Work, p. 12&quot;&gt;Barnes, &quot;Life and Work&quot;, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; However, one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation.  The 5th century [[neoplatonist]] [[Ammonius Hermiae]] writes that Aristotle's writing style is deliberately [[Obscurantism|obscurantist]] so that &quot;good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more, whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Ammonius| year= 1991| title= On Aristotle's Categories| location= Ithaca, NY| publisher= Cornell University Press| isbn= 0-8014-2688-X}} p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;Another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant – that all of Aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind. Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form. (''Fragments'' of some of Aristotle's dialogues have survived.) Perhaps it is to these that [[Cicero]] refers when he characterized Aristotle's writing style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Cicero| first =Marcus Tullius| title =flumen orationis aureum fundens Aristoteles| work =Academica| date =106 BC – 43 BC| url =http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/gutenberg/1/4/9/7/14970/14970-h/14970-h.htm#BkII_119| accessdate =25 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, Life and Work, p. 12&quot;/&gt; However, some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that Cicero's praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works; a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in Aristotle's extant works.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, &quot;Roman Aristotle&quot;, in Gregory Nagy, ''Greek Literature'', Routledge 2001, vol. 8, p. 174 n. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;One major question in the history of Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us?&lt;ref&gt;The definitive, English study of these questions is Barnes, &quot;Roman Aristotle&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by [[Strabo]] in his ''Geography'' and [[Plutarch]] in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sulla.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to [[Neleus of Scepsis]]. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to [[Scepsis]], where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when [[Apellicon of Teos]] discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to Rome, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian [[Tyrannion of Amisus]] and then by the philosopher [[Andronicus of Rhodes]].&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Rome: from the early Republic to the assassination of Julius Caesar – Page 513, Matthew Dillon, Lynda Garland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 22 – Page 131, Grolier Incorporated – Juvenile Nonfiction&lt;/ref&gt;Carnes Lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides &quot;the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B.C.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lord|first=Carnes|title=Introduction to the Politics, by Aristotle|publisher=[[Chicago University Press]]|year=1984|location=Chicago|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however. First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon's inexpert attempt at repair.Second, there is &quot;incontrovertible evidence,&quot; Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis. Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle's texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his. And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus' intervention list an Aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess. Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelian interpolations in the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.On the one hand, the surviving texts of Aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts, but rather from working drafts used within Aristotle's school, as opposed, on the other hand, to the [[Corpus Aristotelicum#Fragments|dialogues and other &quot;exoteric&quot; texts]] which Aristotle published more widely during his lifetime. The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.&lt;ref&gt;Anagnostopoulos, G., &quot;Aristotle's Works and Thoughts&quot;, ''A Companion to Aristotle'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2009), p. 16.

[[Bertrand Russell]] notes that &quot;almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine&quot;. Russell also refers to Aristotle's ethics as &quot;repulsive&quot;, and calls his logic &quot;as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy&quot;. Russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;/&gt;===Later Greek philosophers===The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the [[Peripatetic school]]. Aristotle's notable students included [[Aristoxenus]], [[Dicaearchus]], [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], [[Eudemos of Rhodes]], [[Harpalus]], [[Hephaestion]], [[Meno]], [[Mnason of Phocis]], [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], and [[Theophrastus]]. Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained &quot;Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander''&lt;/ref&gt;===Influence on Byzantine scholars===Greek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus. The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were [[John Philoponus]], Elias, and David in the sixth century, and [[Stephen of Alexandria]] in the early seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ed. ''Aristotle Transformed'' London, 1990, 20, 28, 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Philoponus]] stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle's views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ed. ''Aristotle Transformed'' (London, 1990) 233–274.&lt;/ref&gt; After a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and [[Michael of Ephesus]] reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by [[Anna Comnena]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sorabji, ed. ''Aristotle Transformed'' (London, 1990) 20–21; 28–29, 393–406; 407–408.&lt;/ref&gt;===Influence on Islamic theologians===Aristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early [[Islamic theology]]. Most of the still extant works of Aristotle,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Aristutalis''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a number of the original [[Greece|Greek]] commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by [[Muslim]] philosophers, scientists and scholars.  [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Alpharabius]], who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers. [[Alkindus]] considered Aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy&lt;ref&gt;''Rasa'il'' I, 103, 17, Abu Rida&lt;/ref&gt; and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the &quot;exemplar&quot; for all future philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;''Comm. Magnum'' in Aristotle'', ''De Anima'', III, 2, 43 Crawford&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the &quot;First Teacher&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''al-mua'llim al-thani'', ''Aristutalis''&lt;/ref&gt; The title &quot;teacher&quot; was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars, and was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of Dante) who were influenced by the tradition of [[Islamic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nasr|first=Seyyed Hossein|title=The Islamic Intellectual Tradition in Persia|year=1996|publisher=Curzon Press|isbn=0-7007-0314-4|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;In accordance with the [[Greeks|Greek]] theorists, the Muslims considered Aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher, the author of a closed system, and believed that Aristotle shared with [[Plato]] essential tenets of thought. Some went so far as to credit Aristotle himself with neo-Platonic metaphysical ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;===Influence on Western Christian theologians===With the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c. AD 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the ''Organon'' made by [[Boethius]]. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by [[Gerard of Cremona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{SEP|arabic-islamic-influence|Influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on the Latin West}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the original Greek, such as those by [[James of Venice]] and [[William of Moerbeke]].After [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote his [[theology]], working from Moerbeke's translations, the demand for Aristotle's writings grew and the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{SEP|aristotelianism-renaissance|Aristotelianism in the Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;Aristotle is referred to as &quot;The Philosopher&quot; by [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]. See ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', Part I, Question 3, etc. These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods. The medieval English poet [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] describes his student as being happy by having:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'' at his beddes heed'':''Twenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,'':''Of aristotle and his philosophie,''&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chaucer, ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', Prologue, lines 295–295&lt;/ref&gt;The Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] says of Aristotle in [[The Divine Comedy|the first circles of hell]],:''I saw the Master there of those who know,'':''Amid the philosophic family,'':''By all admired, and by all reverenced;'':''There Plato too I saw, and Socrates,'':''Who stood beside him closer than the rest.''&lt;ref&gt;''vidi 'l maestro di color che sanno''''seder tra filosofica famiglia.''&lt;br&gt;''Tutti lo miran, tutti onor li fanno'':&lt;br&gt;''quivi vid'ïo Socrate e Platone''&lt;br&gt;''che 'nnanzi a li altri più presso li stanno;''&lt;br&gt; Dante, ''L'Inferno'' (Hell), Canto IV. Lines 131–135&lt;/ref&gt;===Post-Enlightenment thinkers===The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; However implausible this is, it is certainly the case that Aristotle's rigid separation of action from production, and his justification of the subservience of slaves and others to the virtue – or ''arete'' – of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy. It is [[Martin Heidegger]], not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition. [[Ayn Rand]] accredited Aristotle as &quot;the greatest philosopher in history&quot; and cited him as a major influence on her thinking. More recently, [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy'', Polity Press, 2007, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;==List of works=={{Main|Corpus Aristotelicum}}The works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school. Reference to them is made according to the organization of [[Immanuel Bekker]]'s Royal Prussian Academy edition (''Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica'', Berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.==Honours==[[Aristotle Mountains]] on [[Oscar II Coast]] in [[Graham Land]], [[Antarctica]] are named after Aristotle who was the first to conjecture the existence of a landmass in the southern high-latitude region, calling it ''Antarctica''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=137410 Aristotle Mountains.] [[SCAR]] [[Composite Antarctic Gazetteer]].&lt;/ref&gt;==See also==*[[Aristotelian physics]]*[[Aristotelian view of God]]*[[Conimbricenses]]*[[Corpus Aristotelicum]]*[[Hylomorphism]]*[[List of writers influenced by Aristotle]]*[[Otium]]*[[Philia]]==Notes and references=={{Reflist|20em}}==Further reading==The secondary literature on Aristotle is vast.

The ASA became the United States of America Standards Institute or USASI&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980211&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p.&amp;nbsp;211.&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately the [[American National Standards Institute]].The X3.2 subcommittee designed ASCII based on the earlier [[teleprinter]] encoding systems. Like other [[character encoding]]s, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and [[character (computing)|character]] symbols (i.e. [[grapheme]]s and [[control character]]s). This allows [[Digital data|digital]] devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 [[English alphabet|alphabetic]] characters, 10 [[numerical digit]]s, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols.To include all these, and control characters compatible with the [[CCITT|Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique]] (CCITT) [[International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA2) standard, [[Fieldata]], and early [[EBCDIC]], more than 64 codes were required for ASCII.The committee debated the possibility of a [[shift key]] function (like the [[Baudot code]]), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by six [[bit]]s. In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes.It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for [[data transmission]]; an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 215, Decision 4&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 215, Decision 4.&lt;/ref&gt;The committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits ([[octet (computing)|octet]]s) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with [[binary coded decimal]]. However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a [[parity bit]] for [[error checking]] if desired.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 217, Decision 5&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 217, Decision 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eight-bit]] machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Stanley A. Sawyer, Steven George Krantz |title=A TeX Primer for Scientists |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bXLDwmIJNkUC&amp;pg=PA13 |year=1995 |publisher=[[CRC Press|CRC Press, LLC]] |isbn=978-0-8493-7159-2 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together, and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification. The first two columns (32 positions) were reserved for control characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 220, Decisions 8,9&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 220, Decisions 8,9.&lt;/ref&gt;} The [[Space (punctuation)|&quot;space&quot; character]] had to come before graphics to make [[sorting algorithm|sorting]] easier, so it became position 20&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;;&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 237, Decision 10&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 237, Decision 10.&lt;/ref&gt; for the same reason, many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits.  The committee decided it was important to support [[upper case]] [[sixbit code pages|64-character alphabets]], and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 228, Decision 14&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 228, Decision 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lower case]] letters were therefore not interleaved with upper case. To keep options available for lower case letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter &quot;A&quot; was placed in position 41&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt; to match the draft of the corresponding British standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980p. 238, Decision 18&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p. 238, Decision 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The digits 0–9 were arranged so they correspond to values in binary prefixed with 011, making conversion with [[binary-coded decimal]] straightforward.Many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters. Thus #, $ and % were placed to correspond to 3, 4, and 5 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0, however, because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character. Since many European typewriters placed the parentheses with 8 and 9, those corresponding positions were chosen for the parentheses. The @ symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented À in the French variation, so the @ was placed in position 40&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt; next to the letter A.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980243&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p.&amp;nbsp;243.&lt;/ref&gt;The control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), [[End of Message|end of message]] (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), &quot;who are you?&quot; (WRU), &quot;are you?&quot; (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK). These were positioned to maximize the [[Hamming distance]] between their bit patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980243-245&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], pp.&amp;nbsp;243-245.&lt;/ref&gt;With the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963, leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie198066, 245&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], pp.&amp;nbsp;66, 245.&lt;/ref&gt; There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lower case alphabet.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980435&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p.&amp;nbsp;435.&lt;/ref&gt; The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lower case characters to columns 6 and 7,&lt;ref&gt;Brief Report: Meeting of CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet, May 13–15, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[International Organization for Standardization]] TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard.&lt;ref&gt;Report of ISO/TC/97/SC 2 – Meeting of October 29–31, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The X3.2.4 task group voted its approval for the change to ASCII at its May 1963 meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Report on Task Group X3.2.4, June 11, 1963, Pentagon Building, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;  Locating the lowercase letters in columns 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified [[case-insensitive]] character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.The X3 committee made other changes, including other new characters (the [[bracket|brace]] and [[vertical bar]] characters),&lt;ref&gt;Report of Meeting No. 8, Task Group X3.2.4, December 17 and 18, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; renaming some control characters (SOM became start of header (SOH)) and moving or removing others (RU was removed).&lt;ref name=&quot;FOOTNOTEMackenzie1980247–248&quot;&gt;[[#CITEREFMackenzie1980|Mackenzie 1980]], p.&amp;nbsp;247–248.&lt;/ref&gt; ASCII was subsequently updated as USASI X3.4-1967, then USASI X3.4-1968, ANSI X3.4-1977, and finally, ANSI X3.4-1986 (the first two are occasionally retronamed ANSI X3.4-1967, and ANSI X3.4-1968).The X3 committee also addressed how ASCII should be transmitted ([[least significant bit]] first), and how it should be recorded on perforated tape. They proposed a [[9-track]] standard for magnetic tape, and attempted to deal with some forms of [[punched card]] formats.ASCII itself was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]]'s TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange) network. TWX originally used the earlier five-bit [[Baudot code]], which was also used by the competing [[Telex]] teleprinter system. [[Bob Bemer]] introduced features such as the [[Escape character|escape sequence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandel&quot; /&gt; His British colleague [[Hugh McGregor Ross]] helped to popularize this work—according to Bemer, &quot;so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the Bemer-Ross Code in Europe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Bemer (n.d.).

Gray [http://csrc.nist.gov/fips/fips1861.pdf]. /* ?? */ --&gt;On March 11, 1968, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] mandated that all computers purchased by the United States federal government support ASCII, stating:&lt;ref&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson (March 11, 1968). [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=28724 Memorandum Approving the Adoption by the Federal Government of a Standard Code for Information Interchange]. ''The American Presidency Project''. Accessed 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I have also approved recommendations of the Secretary of Commerce regarding standards for recording the Standard Code for Information Interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations.All computers and related equipment configurations brought into the Federal Government inventory on and after July 1, 1969, must have the capability to use the Standard Code for Information Interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as [[ISO/IEC 646]] that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English alphabet and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the United Kingdom's [[pound sterling]] (£). Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since ASCII suited the needs of only the USA and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters. Other adapted encodings include [[ISCII]] (India), [[VISCII]] (Vietnam), and [[YUSCII]] (Yugoslavia). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard.ASCII was incorporated into the [[Unicode]] character set as the first 128 symbols, so the ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows [[UTF-8]] to be [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with ASCII, allowing software that handles UTF-8 data to treat ASCII data as UTF-8 data, and software made for ASCII treat UTF-8 data as ASCII data, rather than distinguishing between ASCII and UTF-8.==ASCII control characters=={{main|Control character}}ASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0–31 decimal) for [[control character]]s: codes originally intended not to represent printable information, but rather to control devices (such as [[computer printer|printer]]s) that make use of ASCII, or to provide [[Metadata|meta-information]] about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape. For example, character 10 represents the &quot;line feed&quot; function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents &quot;backspace&quot;. RFC 2822 refers to control characters that do not include carriage return, line feed or [[Whitespace (computer science)|white space]] as non-whitespace control characters.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 2822 (April 2001). &quot;NO-WS-CTL&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Other schemes, such as [[markup language]]s, address page and document layout and formatting.The original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional, for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a [[data stream]], and sometimes accidental, for example with the meaning of &quot;delete&quot;.Probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available [[punched tape|paper tape]] reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 ([[Delete key|Delete]]) became de facto standards. Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of [[underscore]]), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as &quot;delete previous character&quot; was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.The use of Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off) as a &quot;handshaking&quot; signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow, and Control-Q (XON, &quot;transmit on&quot;) to resume sending, persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by a second Control-S to resume output.Code 127 is officially named &quot;delete&quot; but the Teletype label was &quot;rubout&quot;. Since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes, interpretations of this code varied. The original Teletype meaning, and the intent of the standard, was to make it an ignored character, the same as NUL (all zeroes). This was useful specifically for paper tape, because punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it. Tapes designed to be &quot;hand edited&quot; could even be produced with spaces of extra NULs (blank tape) so that a block of characters could be &quot;rubbed out&quot; and then replacements put into the empty space.As video terminals began to replace printing ones, the value of the &quot;rubout&quot; character was lost. DEC systems, for example, interpreted &quot;Delete&quot; to mean &quot;remove the character before the cursor&quot; and this interpretation also became common in Unix systems. Most other systems used &quot;Backspace&quot; for that meaning and used &quot;Delete&quot; to mean &quot;remove the character at the cursor&quot;. That latter interpretation is the most common now.Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones. The &quot;escape&quot; character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. This is the same meaning of &quot;escape&quot; encountered in URL encodings, [[C (programming language)|C language]] strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence, usually in the form of a so-called &quot;[[ANSI escape code]]&quot; (or, more properly, a &quot;Control Sequence Introducer&quot;) beginning with ESC followed by a &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; (left-bracket) character. An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an [[out-of-band]] character used to terminate an operation, as in the [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] and [[vi]] [[text editor]]s. In [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and [[window (computing)|windowing]] systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to [[exit (operating system)|exit]] (terminate) altogether.The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring &quot;plain text&quot; files between systems. The best example of this is the [[newline]] problem on various [[operating system]]s. Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both &quot;Carriage Return&quot; (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and &quot;Line Feed&quot; (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). The name &quot;Carriage Return&quot; comes from the fact that on a manual [[typewriter]] the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the keys struck the ribbon remained stationary.  The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.[[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] operating systems ([[OS/8]], [[RT-11]], [[RSX-11]], [[RSTS/E|RSTS]], [[TOPS-10]], etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally [[Teleprinter|Teletype machines]]) would work. By the time so-called &quot;glass TTYs&quot; (later called CRTs or terminals) came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention. When Gary Kildall cloned [[RT-11]] to create [[CP/M]] he followed established [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] convention.  Until the introduction of [[PC DOS]] in 1981, [[IBM]] had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of &quot;carriage return&quot; was meaningless. IBM's [[PC DOS]] (also marketed as [[MS-DOS]] by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of [[CP/M]], and Windows inherited it from MS-DOS.Unfortunately, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone. To simplify matters [[plain text]] data streams, including files, on [[Multics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.multicians.org/jhs-jfo-terminals.pdf |title=Technical and human engineering problems in connecting terminals to a time-sharing system |last1=Ossanna |first1=J.

[[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, and [[Amiga]] systems, adopted this convention from Multics. The original [[Macintosh OS]], [[Apple DOS]], and [[ProDOS]], on the other hand, used carriage return (CR) alone as a line terminator; however, since Apple replaced it with the Unix-based [[OS X]] operating system, they now use line feed (LF) as well.Computers attached to the [[ARPANET]] included machines running operating systems such as TOPS-10 and [[TOPS-20#TENEX|TENEX]] using CR-LF line endings, machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings, and machines running operating systems such as [[OS/360]] that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used [[EBCDIC]] rather than ASCII.  The [[Telnet]] protocol defined an ASCII &quot;Network Virtual Terminal&quot; (NVT), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network; it used ASCII, along with CR-LF line endings, and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF|title=TELNET Protocol|rfc=158|pages=4-5|author=T.

For this reason, EOF, or [[end-of-file]], was used colloquially and conventionally as a [[three-letter acronym]] (TLA) for Control-Z instead of SUBstitute.  For a variety of reasons, the end-of-text code, [[End-of-text character|ETX]] aka [[Control-C]], was inappropriate and using Z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet, a very convenient [[Mnemonic device|mnemonic aid]]. An historic common, and still prevalent, convention uses the [[End-of-text character|ETX]] aka [[Control-C]] code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream, usually from a keyboard.In C library and Unix conventions, the [[null character]] is used to terminate text [[string (computer science)|string]]s; such [[null-terminated string]]s can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ, where here Z stands for &quot;zero&quot;.===ASCII control code chart==={| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;|-!

To delete the previous character, one had to back up the paper tape punch, which for mechanical and simplicity reasons was a button on the punch itself and not the keyboard, then type the rubout character. They therefore placed a key producing rubout at the location used on typewriters for backspace. When systems used these terminals and provided command-line editing, they had to use the &quot;rubout&quot; code to perform a backspace, and often did not interpret the backspace character (they might echo &quot;&lt;tt&gt;^H&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; for backspace). Other terminals not designed for paper tape made the key at this location produce Backspace, and systems designed for these used that character to back up.

Accessed 2008-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt;* us* IBM367* cp367* csASCII&lt;/div&gt;Of these, the IANA encourages use of the name &quot;US-ASCII&quot; for Internet uses of ASCII (even if it is a [[RAS syndrome|redundant acronym]], but the US is needed because of abuse of the ASCII term). One often finds this in the optional &quot;charset&quot; parameter in the Content-Type header of some MIME messages, in the equivalent &quot;meta&quot; element of some [[HTML]] documents, and in the encoding declaration part of the prologue of some [[XML]] documents.==Variants==As computer technology spread throughout the world, different [[Standardization|standards bodies]] and corporations developed many variations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets. One could class some of these variations as &quot;[[Extended ASCII|ASCII extensions]]&quot;, although some misuse that term to represent all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII's character-map in the 7-bit range.The [[PETSCII]] code [[Commodore International]] used for their [[8-bit]] systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963, instead of the more common ASCII-1967, such as found on the [[ZX Spectrum character set|ZX Spectrum]] computer. [[ATASCII|Atari]] 8-bit computers and [[Galaksija (computer)#Character ROM|Galaksija]] computers also used ASCII variants.===7-bit===From early in its development,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Specific Criteria,&quot; attachment to memo from R. W. Reach, &quot;X3-2 Meeting – September 14 and 15,&quot; September 18, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard, ultimately published as [[ISO/IEC 646]] (1972), which would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several [[code point]]s reserved for &quot;national use.&quot;  However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967&lt;ref&gt;R. Maréchal, ISO/TC 97 – Computers and Information Processing: Acceptance of Draft ISO Recommendation No. 1052, December 22, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.ISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, was a 7-bit character set. It did not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented, and in general text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.Because the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to &quot;national use&quot; code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc. programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as:&lt;code&gt;ä aÄiÜ='Ön'; ü&lt;/code&gt;instead of:&lt;code&gt;{ a[i]=''; }&lt;/code&gt;[[C trigraph]]s were created to solve this problem for [[ANSI C]], although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use.===8-bit===Eventually, as 8-, [[16-bit|16-]] and [[32-bit]] (and later [[64-bit]]) computers began to replace [[18-bit|18-]] and [[36-bit]] computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit, relatives of ASCII. In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters.Most early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs, and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0-31 with more graphics. The IBM PC defined [[code page 437]], which replaced the control-characters with graphic symbols such as [[Emoticon|smiley faces]], and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. Operating systems such as [[DOS]] supported these code-pages, and manufacturers of [[IBM PC]]s supported them in hardware. [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] developed the [[Multinational Character Set]] (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular [[VT220]] [[computer terminal|terminal]], this was one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. The Macintosh defined [[Mac OS Roman]] and Postscript also defined a set, both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets. The [[ISO/IEC 8859]] standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) finally provided a standard that most systems copied (at least as accurately as they copied ASCII, but with many substitutions). A popular further extension designed by Microsoft, [[Windows-1252]] (often mislabeled as ISO-8859-1), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for attractive text printing.ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encodings until the late 2000s, nowadays [[UTF-8]] is becoming more common.&lt;ref name=&quot;utf-8-2008&quot; /&gt;===Unicode===[[Unicode]] and the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) have a much wider array of characters, and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using [[natural number]]s called ''code points'') and encoding (to 8-, 16- or 32-bit binary formats, called [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]] and [[UTF-32]]).To allow backward compatibility, the 128 ASCII and 256 ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) characters are assigned Unicode/UCS code points that are the same as their codes in the earlier standards. Therefore, ASCII can be considered a 7-bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of Unicode/UCS, and ASCII (when prefixed with 0 as the eighth bit) is valid UTF-8.==Order==ASCII-code order is also called ''ASCIIbetical'' order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=ASCIIbetical&amp;i=38025,00.asp |title=ASCIIbetical definition |magazine=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Collation]] of data is sometimes done in this order rather than &quot;standard&quot; alphabetical order ([[collating sequence]]). The main deviations in ASCII order are:* All uppercase come before lowercase letters, for example, &quot;Z&quot; before &quot;a&quot;* Digits and many punctuation marks come before letters; for example, &quot;4&quot; precedes &quot;one&quot;* Numbers are sorted naïvely as strings; for example, &quot;10&quot; precedes &quot;2&quot;An intermediate order — readily implemented — converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values. Naïve number sorting can be averted by [[Leading zero|zero-filling]] all numbers (e.g. &quot;02&quot; will sort before &quot;10&quot; as expected), although this is an external fix and has nothing to do with the ordering itself.==See also==* [[3568 ASCII]], an asteroid named after the character encoding* [[ASCII art]]* [[ASCII Ribbon Campaign]]* [[Extended ASCII]]* [[HTML decimal character rendering]]==References=={{Citation style|date=February 2013|details=One consistent form of citation must be used; currently, two mixed forms are being used}};Footnotes{{Reflist|30em}};Bibliography* {{cite book |last=Mackenzie |first=Charles E. |title=Coded Character Sets, History and Development |year=1980 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-14460-3 |ref=harv}}==Further reading==&lt;!--I'm adding some additional resources here, both for the benefit of readers, and for use in providing inline citations for currently uncited items, above.

The [[cinématographe]] was a projector, printer, and camera in one machine that allowed moving pictures to be shown successfully on a screen which was invented by history's earliest film makers, [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]], in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin|first=Dan|title=A RATHER INCOMPLETE BUT STILL FASCINATING|url=http://animation.filmtv.ucla.edu/NewSite/WebPages/Histories.html|work=Film Tv|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;The [[phenakistoscope]] (1832), [[zoetrope]] (1834) and [[praxinoscope]] (1877), as well as the common [[flip book]], were early animation devices to produce movement from sequential drawings using technological means, but animation did not develop further until the advent of [[film|motion picture film]].The first animated projection (screening) was created in France, by [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]], who was a French science teacher. Reynaud created the [[Praxinoscope]] in 1877 and the Théâtre Optique in December 1888. On 28 October 1892, he projected the first animation in public, ''[[Pauvre Pierrot]]'', at the Musée Grévin in Paris. This film is also notable as the first known instance of film perforations being used. His films were not photographed, but drawn directly onto the transparent strip. In 1900, more than 500,000 people had attended these screenings.[[File:Lanature1882 praxinoscope projection reynaud.png|thumb|Praxinoscope, The first projection (1877)]]The first film that was recorded on [[standard picture film]] and included animated sequences was the 1900 [[The Enchanted Drawing|Enchanted Drawing]], which was followed by the first entirely animated film - the 1906 ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' by [[J. Stuart Blackton]], who, because of that, is considered the father of American animation.[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|The first animated film created by using what came to be known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]] - the 1908 ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' by [[Émile Cohl]]]]In Europe, the French artist, [[Émile Cohl]], created the first animated film using what came to be known as [[traditional animation]] creation methods - the 1908 ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]''. The film largely consisted of a [[stick figure]] moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects, such as a wine bottle that transforms into a flower. There were also sections of live action in which the animator’s hands would enter the scene. The film was created by drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each frame onto [[negative film]], which gave the picture a blackboard look.The author of the first [[puppet]]-animated film (''The Beautiful Lukanida'' (1912)) was the Russian-born (ethnically [[Poles|Polish]]) director Wladyslaw Starewicz, known as [[Ladislas Starevich]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}The more detailed hand-drawn animations, requiring a team of animators drawing each frame manually with detailed backgrounds and characters, were those directed by [[Winsor McCay]], a successful newspaper cartoonist, including the 1911 ''[[Little Nemo]]'', the 1914 ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'', and the 1918 ''[[The Sinking of the Lusitania]]''.During the 1910s, the production of animated short films, typically referred to as &quot;cartoons&quot;, became an industry of its own and cartoon shorts were produced for showing in movie theaters. The most successful producer at the time was [[John Randolph Bray]], who, along with [[animator]] [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[Traditional animation#Cels|cel animation]] process which dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade.''[[El Apóstol]]'' (Spanish: &quot;The Apostle&quot;) was a 1917 Argentine animated film utilizing cutout animation, and the world's first animated feature film.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/93678-El_Apostol.html El Apóstol]&quot;. ''www.bcdb.com'',  4 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, a fire that destroyed producer Frederico Valle's film studio incinerated the only known copy of ''El Apóstol'', and it is now considered a [[lost film]].[[Computer animation]] has become popular since ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), the first animated film completely made using this technique.In 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boi.gov.ph/pdf/valuepropositions/Animation/Animation.pdf |title=Animation |date=November 2009|accessdate= 2012-07-24|work= boi.gov.ph|publisher= Board of Investments}}&lt;/ref&gt;== Techniques ===== Traditional animation ==={{Main|Traditional animation}}'''Traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century. The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings that are first drawn on paper. To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s, which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings. The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film .The traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system. Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects. The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35&amp;nbsp;mm film]] and newer media such as [[digital video]]. The &quot;look&quot; of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years. Some animation producers have used the term &quot;tradigital&quot; to describe cel animation which makes extensive use of computer technology.Examples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940), ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), and [[The Illusionist (2010 film)|L'Illusionniste]] (British-French, 2010). Traditional animated films which were produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994), ''[[Akira (film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988), ''[[Spirited Away|Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away)]]'' (Japan, 2001), ''[[Les Triplettes de Belleville]]'' (France, 2003), and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).[[File:Animated GIF from the 1919 Feline folies by Pat Sullivan.gif|thumb|250px|right|Excerpt from the 1919 ''Feline Follies'' with [[Felix the Cat]].]][[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|left|200px|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th century photos]]* '''Full animation''' refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement. Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works such as those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Lion King|Lion King]]'') to the more 'cartoon' styles of the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros. animation studio]]. Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works such as ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007).* '''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed and/or more stylized drawings and methods of movement. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]], limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and much of the [[anime]] produced in Japan. Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media such as television (the work of [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Filmation]], and other TV animation studios) and later [[the Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).* '''[[Rotoscoping]]''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, [[frame (film)|frame]] by frame. The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings, as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are: ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (USA, 1983) and ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981).* '''[[Films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots. One of the earlier uses  was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live action footage. Other examples include ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (USA, 1988), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (USA, 1996) and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (USA, 2001).=== Stop motion animation ==={{Main|Stop motion}}'''Stop-motion animation''' is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement. There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation. Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; however, traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive and time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.* '''[[Puppet animation]]''' typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation. The puppets generally have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] inside of them to keep them still and steady as well as to constrain their motion to particular joints. Examples include ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (France, 1937), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (US, 1993), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (US, 2005), ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (US, 2009), the films of [[Jiří Trnka]] and the TV series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (US, 2005–present).** '''[[Puppetoon]]''', created using techniques developed by [[George Pal]], are puppet-animated films which typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet. [[File:Animacion-con-plastilina-y-clay-animation-pelicula-Kuzmich-153.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Clay animation]]]]* '''[[Clay animation]]''', or [[Plasticine]] animation (often called ''claymation'', which, however, is a [[Laika (company)|trademark]]ed name), uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation. The figures may have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures. Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, such as in the films of [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]], where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes. Examples of clay-animated works include ''[[Gumby|The Gumby Show]]'' (US, 1957–1967) ''[[Morph (character)|Morph]]'' shorts (UK, 1977–2000), ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' shorts (UK, as of 1989), [[Jan Švankmajer]]'s ''[[Dimensions of Dialogue]]'' ([[Czechoslovakia]], 1982), ''[[The Trap Door]]'' (UK, 1984). Films include ''[[Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', ''[[Chicken Run]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Mark Twain (1985 film)|The Adventures of Mark Twain]]''.* '''[[Cutout animation]]''' is a type of stop-motion animation produced by moving two-dimensional pieces of material such as paper or cloth. Examples include [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animated sequences from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (UK, 1969–1974); ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'' (France/Czechoslovakia, 1973) ; ''[[Tale of Tales (film)|Tale of Tales]]'' (Russia, 1979), The pilot episode of the TV series (and sometimes in episodes) of ''[[South Park]]'' (US, 1997). [[File:Claychick.jpg|thumb|225px|left|A clay animation scene from a [[Finland|Finnish]] television commercial]]** '''[[Silhouette animation]]''' is a variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes. Examples include ''[[The Adventures of Prince Achmed]]'' ([[Weimar Republic]], 1926) and ''[[Ciné si|Princes et princesses]]'' (France, 2000).* '''[[Model animation]]''' refers to stop-motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live-action world. Intercutting, [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]] effects, and split screens are often employed to blend stop-motion characters or objects with live actors and settings. Examples include the work of [[Ray Harryhausen]], as seen in films such ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963), and the work of [[Willis O'Brien]] on films such as ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933 film).** '''[[Go motion]]''' is a variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create  [[motion blur]] between frames of film, which is not present in traditional stop-motion. The technique was invented by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] and [[Phil Tippett]] to create [[special effects]] scenes for the film ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980). Another example is the dragon named &quot;Vermithrax&quot; from ''[[Dragonslayer]]'' (1981 film).* '''[[Object animation]]''' refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.** '''[[Graphic animation]]''' uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.), which are sometimes manipulated frame-by-frame to create movement. At other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action.** '''[[Brickfilm]]''' A sub-genre of object animation involving using [[Lego]] or other similar brick toys to make an animation. These have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites like YouTube and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software.* '''[[Pixilation]]''' involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters. This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other such effects. Examples of pixilation include ''[[The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb]]'' and ''[[Angry Kid]]'' shorts.=== Computer animation ==={{Main|Computer animation}}'''Computer animation''' encompasses a variety of techniques, the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer. This animation takes less time to produce than previous traditional animation. 2D animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3D techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact. 3D animation can create images that seem real to the viewer.==== 2D animation ====[[File:Animation-W.gif|thumb|132x132px]][[2D computer graphics|2D animation]] figures are created and/or edited on the computer using 2D [[bitmap graphics]] or created and edited using 2D [[vector graphics]]. This includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques such as [[interpolated]] [[morphing]], [[onion skinning]] and [[interpolated]] rotoscoping.2D animation has many applications, including [[Scanimate|analog computer animation]], [[Flash animation]] and [[PowerPoint animation]]. [[Cinemagraph]]s are [[still photograph]]s in the form of an [[animated GIF]] file of which part is animated.===== 2D Terms =====* '''[[Final line advection animation]]''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3dworldmag.com/2012/06/29/disneys-paperman-animated-short-fuses-cg-and-hand-drawn-techniques/ Disney’s Paperman animated short fuses CG and hand-drawn techniques]&lt;/ref&gt; a technique that gives the artists and animators a lot more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department: &lt;blockquote&gt;''In [[Paperman]], we didn’t have a cloth department and we didn’t have a hair department. Here, folds in the fabric, hair silhouettes and the like come from of the committed design decision-making that comes with the 2D drawn process. Our animators can change things, actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want, and change the profile of the arm. And they can design all the fabric in that [[Milt Kahl]] kind-of way, if they want to.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartoonbrew.com/cgi/a-little-more-about-disneys-paperman-63782.html A Little More About Disney’s “Paperman”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;==== 3D animation ===={{Main|Computer animation|3D computer graphics}}3D animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator. The animator starts by creating an external 3D mesh to manipulate. A mesh is a geometric configuration that gives the visual appearance of form to a 3D object or 3D environment. The mesh may have many vertices which are the geometric points which make up the mesh; it is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh with weights. This process is called rigging and can be programmed for movement with keyframes.Other techniques can be applied, such as mathematical functions (e.g., gravity, particle simulations), simulated fur or hair, and effects such as fire and water simulations. These techniques fall under the category of 3D dynamics.===== 3D Terms =====* '''[[Cel-shaded animation]]''' is used to mimic traditional animation using CG software. Shading looks stark, with less blending of colors. Examples include, ''[[Skyland]]'' (2007, France), ''[[Appleseed Ex Machina]]'' (2007, Japan), ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker]]'' (2002, Japan)* '''[[Machinima]]''' – Films created by screen capturing in video games and virtual worlds.* '''[[Motion capture]]''' is used when live-action actors wear special suits that allow computers to copy their movements into CG characters. Examples include ''[[Polar Express]]'' (2004, USA), ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'' (2007, USA), ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' (2009, USA), ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' (2011, USA)* '''[[Computer animation|Photo-realistic animation]]''' is used primarily for animation that attempts to resemble real life, using advanced rendering that mimics in detail skin, plants, water, fire, clouds, etc. Examples include ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' (2009, USA), ''[[Kung-Fu Panda]]'' (2008, USA), ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' (2002, USA).=== Mechanical animation ===[[File:Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln.jpg|thumb|left|Audio-Animatronic version of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln.]]* '''[[Animatronics]]''' is the use of [[mechatronics]] to create machines which seem animate rather than robotic.** '''[[Audio-Animatronics|Audio-Animatronics and Autonomatronics]]''' is a form of [[robotic]]s animation, combined with 3-D animation, created by [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] for shows and attractions at Disney theme parks move and make noise (generally a recorded speech or song), but are fixed to whatever supports them. They can sit and stand but cannot walk. An Audio-Animatron is different from an [[android (robot)|android]]-type robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds, rather than responding to external stimuli. In 2009, Disney created an interactive version of the technology called Autonomatronics.** '''Linear Animation Generator''' is a form of animation by using static picture frames installed in a tunnel or a shaft. The animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in a linear motion, parallel to the installed picture frames. The concept and the technical solution, were invented in 2007 by Mihai Girlovan in Romania.* '''[[Chuckimation]]''' is a type of animation created by the makers of the cartoon [[Action League Now!]] in which characters/props are thrown, or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands,* '''[[Puppetry]]''' is a form of theatre or performance animation that involves the manipulation of puppets. It is very ancient, and is believed to have originated 3000 years BC.[1] Puppetry takes many forms but they all share the process of animating inanimate performing objects. Puppetry is used in almost all human societies both as entertainment – in performance – and ceremonially in rituals and celebrations such as carnivals. Most puppetry involves storytelling.[[File:Toy Story Zoetrope, Disney California Adventure 2.jpg|thumb|''[[Toy Story]]'' zoetrope at [[Disney California Adventure]] creates illusion of motion using figures, rather than static pictures.]]* '''[[Zoetrope]]''' is a device that produces the illusion of motion from a rapid succession of static pictures. The term zoetrope is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ζωή (''zoē''), meaning &quot;alive, active&quot;, and τρόπος (''tropos''), meaning &quot;turn&quot;, with &quot;zoetrope&quot; taken to mean &quot;active turn&quot; or &quot;wheel of life&quot;.=== Other animation styles, techniques and approaches ===* '''[[Drawn on film animation]]''': a technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on [[film stock]], for example by [[Norman McLaren]], [[Len Lye]] and [[Stan Brakhage]].* '''[[Paint-on-glass animation]]''': a technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying [[oil paint]]s on sheets of glass, for example by [[Aleksandr Petrov (animator)|Aleksandr Petrov]].* '''Erasure animation''': a technique using traditional 2D media, photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image. For example, [[William Kentridge]] is famous for his [[charcoal]] erasure films, and [[Piotr Dumała]] for his auteur technique of animating scratches on plaster.* '''[[Pinscreen animation]]''': makes use of a screen filled with movable pins that can be moved in or out by pressing an object onto the screen. The screen is lit from the side so that the pins cast shadows. The technique has been used to create animated films with a range of textural effects difficult to achieve with traditional cel animation.* '''[[Sand animation]]''': sand is moved around on a back- or front-lighted piece of glass to create each frame for an animated film. This creates an interesting effect when animated because of the [[light]] [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]].* '''[[Flip book]]''': a flip book (sometimes, especially in British English, called a flick book) is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next, so that when the pages are turned rapidly, the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change. Flip books are often illustrated books for children, but may also be geared towards adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings. Flip books are not always separate books, but may appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines, often in the page corners. Software packages and websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom-made flip books.* '''[[Character animation]]'''* '''[[Multi-sketch]]ing'''* '''[[Special effects animation]]'''==Awards==As with any other form of media, animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field. The original awards for animation were presented by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th [[Academy Awards]] function. The first winner of the [[Academy Award]] was the short [[Flowers and Trees]], a production by [[Walt Disney Productions]] and [[United Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemayavideotutorials.com/what-is-new/flowers-and-trees-1932-ist-oscar-award-winner-3d-animation-movie.html Flowers And Trees [1932&amp;#93; , Ist Oscar Award Winner 3D Animation Movie | Free Maya Video Tutorials&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Academy Award for a feature length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. It was won by the movie [[Shrek]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126029/awards Shrek (2001) - Awards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; produced by [[DreamWorks]] and [[Pacific Data Images]]. Since then, Disney/Pixar have produced the most movies either to win or be nominated for the award. The list of both awards can be obtained here:*[[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]*[[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]Several other countries have instituted an award for best animated feature film as part of their national film awards: [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006), [[César Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2011), [[Goya Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 1989), [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]] (since 2007). Also since 2007, the [[Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] has been awarded at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]]. Since 2009, the [[European Film Awards]] have awarded the [[European Film Award for Best Animated Film]].The [[Annie Award]] is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation. Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor. They were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for Best Animated feature. The 1990s winners were dominated by Walt Disney, however newer studios, led by Pixar &amp; DreamWorks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award.

According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and then on into the Stalin era in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/george-orwells-animal-farm-historical-context-pt-1-3/8177.html BBC Learning Zone, ''Animal Farm'']&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell, a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]],&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. &quot;[[Why I Write]]&quot; (1936) (''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1 – An Age Like This 1945–1950'' p. 23 (Penguin))&lt;/ref&gt; was a critic of [[Joseph Stalin]] and hostile to Moscow-directed [[Stalinism]], especially after his experiences with the [[NKVD]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, writing in his review of [[Franz Borkenau]]'s ''The Spanish Cockpit'' in ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'', 31 July 1937, and &quot;Spilling the Spanish Beans&quot;, ''New English Weekly'', 29 July 1937&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union]], he believed, had become a brutal dictatorship, built upon a [[cult of personality]] and enforced by [[Moscow Show Trials|a reign of terror]]. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described ''Animal Farm'' as a satirical tale against Stalin &quot;''un conte satirique contre Stalin''&quot;,{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} and in his essay &quot;[[Why I Write]]&quot; (1946), he wrote that ''Animal Farm'' was the first book in which he had tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, &quot;to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole&quot;.The original title was ''Animal Farm: A Fairy Story'', though the subtitle was dropped by U.S. publishers for its 1946 publication and subsequently all but one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime omitted it. Other variations in the title include: ''A Satire'' and ''A Contemporary Satire''.{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} Orwell suggested the title ''Union des républiques socialistes animales'' for the French translation, which recalled the French name of the [[Soviet Union]], ''Union des républiques socialistes soviétiques'', and which abbreviates to URSA, the [[Latin]] for &quot;bear&quot;, a [[Russian bear|symbol of Russia]].{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}}Orwell wrote the book from November 1943–February 1944, when the wartime alliance with the Soviet Union was at its height and Stalin was held in highest esteem in Britain among the people and intelligentsia, a fact that Orwell hated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bradbury, Malcolm]], Introduction, p. vi, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers, including one of Orwell's own, [[Victor Gollancz]]. Its publication was thus delayed, though it became a great commercial success when it did finally appear partly because the [[Cold War]] so quickly followed [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt; Dickstein, Morris. ''Cambridge Companion to Orwell'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;''Time'' magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005|p=}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]]. It won a Retrospective [[Hugo Award]] in 1996, and is also included in the [[Great Books of the Western World]] selection.==Plot summary==[[Old Major]], the old boar on the Manor Farm, summons the animals on the farm together for a meeting, during which he refers to humans as [[parasite]]s and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called ''[[Beasts of England]]''. When Major dies, two young pigs, [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] and [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], assume command and consider it a duty to prepare for the Rebellion. The animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible farmer [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr Jones]] from the farm, renaming it &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. They adopt Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, &quot;All animals are equal.&quot;Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of Animalism. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health. Napoleon and Snowball struggle for preeminence. When Snowball announces his plans to build a [[windmill]], Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away and subsequently declares himself leader of Animal Farm.Napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm. Through a young pig named [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]], Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project. Once Snowball becomes a [[scapegoat]], Napoleon begins to [[Reign of Terror|purge]] the farm with his dogs, killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival. ''Beasts of England'' is replaced by an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man. The animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were under Mr Jones.[[Frederick (Animal Farm)|Mr Frederick]], one of the neighboring farmers, attacks the farm, using [[Explosive material|blasting powder]] to blow up the restored windmill. Though the animals win the battle, they do so [[Pyrrhic victory|at great cost]], as many, including [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] the workhorse, are wounded. Despite his injuries, Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to the veterinary surgeon, explaining that better care can be given there. Benjamin, the cynical donkey who &quot;could read as well as any pig&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George (1946). ''Animal Farm''. London: Penguin Group. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; notices that the van belongs to a [[knacker]], and attempts a futile rescue. Squealer reports that the van was purchased by the hospital and the writing from the previous owner had not been repainted. But in reality, Napoleon has sold his most loyal and long-suffering worker for money to buy himself [[whisky]].{{anchor|moreEqual}}Years pass, and the pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are abridged to a single phrase: &quot;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others&quot;. Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name &quot;The Manor Farm&quot;. As the animals look from pigs to humans, they realize they can no longer distinguish between the two.==Characters=====Pigs===*[[Old Major]] – An aged prize [[Middle White|Middle White boar]] provides the inspiration that fuels the Rebellion in the book. He is an allegorical combination of [[Karl Marx]], one of the creators of communism, and [[Lenin]], the communist leader of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the early Soviet nation, in that he draws up the principles of the revolution. His skull being put on revered public display recalls Lenin, whose [[Lenin's Mausoleum|embalmed body was put on display]].&lt;ref name=RoddenIntro/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hitchens/&gt;*[[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]] – &quot;A large, rather fierce-looking [[Berkshire (pig)|Berkshire]] boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way&quot;.{{sfn|Orwell|1979|loc=chapter II|p=15}} An allegory of [[Joseph Stalin]],&lt;ref name=RoddenIntro/&gt; Napoleon is the main villain of ''Animal Farm''.

At first he is used to acquire goods needed for the farm, such as dog biscuits and paraffin, but later he procures luxuries like alcohol for the pigs.===Equines===*[[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] – Boxer is a loyal, kind, dedicated, and respectable cart-horse, although quite naive and gullible.*'''Mollie''' – Self-centered, self-indulgent and vain young white mare who quickly leaves for another farm after the revolution. She is only once mentioned again, in a manner similar to those who left Russia after the fall of the Tsar.*'''Clover''' - Clover is a female horse. She is caring, especially for Boxer, who all too often will push himself too hard. She seems to catch on to the sly tricks and schemes set up by Napoleon and Squealer.*[[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]] – A donkey, one of the oldest animals. He has the worst temper, but is one of the wisest animals on the farm, and is one of the few who can read properly.

She, like Benjamin and Snowball, is one of the few animals on the farm who can read.*'''The Puppies''' – Offspring of Jessie and Bluebell, taken away from them by Napoleon at birth and reared by Napoleon to be his security force.*'''Moses''' – An old raven who occasionally visits the farm, regaling its denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called Sugarcandy Mountain, where he avers that all animals go when they die—but only if they work hard. Orwell portrays [[religion]] as &quot;the black raven of priestcraft—promising pie in the sky when you die, and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power.&quot; The raven &quot;was Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker.&quot; Napoleon brings the raven back, (Ch. IX) as Stalin brought back the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=Dickstein141/&gt;*'''The Sheep''' – They show limited understanding of the situations but nonetheless blindly support Napoleon's ideals with vocal jingles during his speeches and meetings with Snowball.*'''The Hens''' – The hens are among the first to rebel against Napoleon.*'''The Cows''' – Their milk is stolen by the pigs, who learn to milk them. The milk is stirred into the pigs' mash every day, while the other animals are denied such luxuries.*'''The Cat''' – Never seen to carry out any work, the cat is absent for long periods, and is forgiven because her excuses are so convincing and she &quot;purred so affectionately that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; She has no interest in the politics of the farm, and the only time she is recorded as having participated in an election, she is found to have actually &quot;voted on both sides&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;==Composition and publication=====Origin===George Orwell wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 subsequent to his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which he described in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938). In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of ''Animal Farm'', he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him &quot;how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries&quot;. This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the [[Stalinist]] corruption of the original socialist ideals.{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}}Immediately prior to his writing, Orwell had quit the [[BBC]]. He was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the Ministry of Information had put out. The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, such as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination.&lt;ref&gt;[[Overy, Richard]], ''Why the Allies Won'', p. 297 ISBN 0-393-03925-0&lt;/ref&gt;In the preface, Orwell also described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm:{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}}{{quote| ...I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn.

Four publishers refused; one had initially accepted the work but declined after consulting the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].{{sfn|Dag|2004|p=}}&lt;ref&gt;[[#GOIT|Orwell 1976 page 25 ''La libertà di stampa'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, [[Secker and Warburg]] published the first edition in 1945.During [[World War II]], it became apparent to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch — including his regular publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. He also submitted the manuscript to [[Faber and Faber]], where the poet [[T. S. Eliot]] (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising its &quot;good writing&quot; and &quot;fundamental integrity&quot;, but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint &quot;which I take to be generally [[Deformed workers' state|Trotskyite]]&quot;. Eliot said he found the view &quot;not convincing&quot;, and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue &quot;what was needed.. was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs&quot;.&lt;ref name=Eliot/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09-004&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09|title=T.S.

Anti-Russian books do appear, but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle.&quot;The publisher [[Jonathan Cape]], who had initially accepted ''Animal Farm'', subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British [[UK Ministry of Information|Ministry of Information]] warned him off&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; — although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[spy]].{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=337}} Writing to [[Leonard Moore (literary agent)|Leonard Moore]], a partner in the literary agency of Christy &amp; Moore, publisher Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information. Such flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable, and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive. It may reasonably be assumed that the 'important official' was a man named [[Peter Smollett]], who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orwell Subverted p.3&quot;&gt;''Orwell Subverted'', Daniel J. Leab, Penn State Press, 2007 p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka, and he would be one of the names Orwell [[Orwell's list|included in his list]] of Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to the Information Research Department in 1949. Born Hans Peter Smolka in Vienna in 1912, he came to Britain in 1933 as an [[NKVD]] agent with the codename 'Abo',&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Orwell'', p. 210; The Mitrokhin Archive, The KGB in Europe and the West, Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; became a naturalized British subject in 1938, changed his name, and after the outbreak of World War II joined the Ministry of Information where he organised pro-Soviet propaganda, working with [[Kim Philby]] in 1943-45.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordievsky, Oleg]]. ''KGB: The Inside Story'', 1991, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; Smollett's family have rejected the accusation that he was a spy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orwell Subverted p.3&quot;/&gt; The publisher wrote to Orwell, saying:&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;{{quote |If the fable were addressed generally to dictators and dictatorships at large then publication would be all right, but the fable does follow, as I see now, so completely the progress of the Russian Soviets and their two dictators [Lenin and Stalin], that it can apply only to Russia, to the exclusion of the other dictatorships.Another thing: it would be less offensive if the predominant caste in the fable were not pigs. I think the choice of pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many people, and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy, as undoubtedly the Russians are.}}[[Frederic Warburg]] also faced pressures against publication, even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the heroic [[Red Army]],&lt;ref&gt;''George Orwell, A Personal Memoir'', T. R. Fyvel, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; which had played a major part in defeating Hitler. A Russian translation was printed in the paper ''Posev'', and in giving permission for a Russian translation of ''Animal Farm'', Orwell refused in advance all royalties. A translation in Ukrainian, which was produced in Germany, was confiscated in large part by the American wartime authorities and handed over to the Soviet repatriation commission.&lt;ref&gt;[[Struve, Gleb]]. ''Telling the Russians'', written for the Russian journal ''New Russian Wind'', reprinted in Remembering Orwell, p.260-261&lt;/ref&gt;In October 1945, Orwell wrote to Fredric Warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] might illustrate ''Animal Farm''. Low had written a letter saying that he had had &quot;a good time with ''ANIMAL FARM'' - an excellent bit of satire - it would illustrate perfectly.&quot; Nothing came of this, and a trial issue produced by Secker &amp; Warburg in 1956 illustrated by John Driver was abandoned, but the [[Folio Society]] published an edition in 1984 illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]] and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist [[Ralph Steadman]] was published by Secker &amp; Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of ''Animal Farm''.&lt;ref&gt;Smothered Under Journalism, p.123 &amp; I Belong to the Left, p.313-314&lt;/ref&gt;===&quot;The Freedom of the Press&quot;===Orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British [[self-censorship]] and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally. &quot;The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary....

However, the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author's proof composited from the manuscript. For reasons unknown, no preface was supplied, and all the page numbers needed to be redone at the last minute.&lt;ref name=GOIT15/&gt;&lt;ref name=TFOTP/&gt;Years later, in 1972, Ian Angus found the original typescript titled &quot;The Freedom of the Press&quot;, and Bernard Crick published it, together with his own introduction, in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 15 September 1972&lt;ref name=GOIT15/&gt; as &quot;How the essay came to be written&quot;.&lt;ref name=TFOTP/&gt; Orwell's essay criticised British self-censorship by the press, specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government.&lt;ref name=TFOTP/&gt; The same essay also appeared in the Italian 1976 Animal Farm edition, with another introduction by Crick, claiming to be the first edition with the preface.&lt;ref name=GOIT15/&gt; Other publishers were still declining to publish it.{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=more details needed, were some actively refusing, unaware of the preface?}}==Critical response==Contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive. Writing in the American ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' magazine, George Soule expressed his disappointment in the book, writing that it &quot;puzzled and saddened me. It seemed on the whole dull. The allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly.&quot; Soule argued that the animals were not consistent enough with their real world inspirations, and said, &quot;It seems to me that the failure of this book (commercially it is already assured of tremendous success) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Soule, G. (2 September 1946). &quot;Orwell's Fables&quot;. ''The New Republic'', pp. 266–267.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Tosco Fyvel]], writing in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'', 24 August 1945, called the book &quot;a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us.&quot; [[Julian Symons]] responded, on 7 September, &quot;Should we not expect, in ''Tribune'' at least, acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State - [[Soviet Russia]]? It seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky, and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author, upon a political ground. In a hundred years time perhaps, ''Animal Farm'' may be simply a fairy story, today it is a political satire with a good deal of point.&quot;''Animal Farm'' has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, ''Collected Works, I Belong to the Left'', p.253&lt;/ref&gt; It is now highly regarded, having received universal praise and is often considered one of the greatest books of the 20th century.{{bywhom|date=September 2013}}==Analysis=====Animalism==={{redirect|Seven Commandments|the Noahide code|Seven Laws of Noah}}The pigs Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer adapt Old Major's ideas into &quot;a complete system of thought&quot;, which they formally name Animalism. Soon after, Napoleon and Squealer indulge in the vices of humans (drinking alcohol, sleeping in beds, trading). Squealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation, an [[allusion]] to the Soviet government's revising of history in order to exercise control of the people's beliefs about themselves and their society.&lt;ref name=Rodden1999/&gt;[[File:Animal Farm artwork.jpg|thumb|right|230px| Squealer sprawls at the foot of the end wall of the big barn where the Seven Commandments were written (ch. viii)—preliminary artwork for a 1950 strip cartoon by [[Norman Pett]] and Donald Freeman]]The original commandments are:# Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.# Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.# No animal shall wear clothes.# No animal shall sleep in a bed.# No animal shall drink alcohol.# No animal shall kill any other animal.# All animals are equal.Later, Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law-breaking. The changed commandments are as follows, with the changes bolded:&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;No animal shall sleep in a bed '''with sheets.'''&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No animal shall drink alcohol '''to excess.'''&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No animal shall kill any other animal '''without cause.'''&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Eventually, these are replaced with the maxims, &quot;All animals are equal, '''but some animals are more equal than others'''&quot;, and &quot;Four legs good, two legs '''better!'''&quot; as the pigs become more human. This is an [[Irony|ironic]] twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans' evil habits. Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda.&lt;ref name=Carr2010/&gt;===Significance and allegory===[[File:Animalism flag.svg|thumb|The Horn and Hoof Flag described in the book appears to be based on the [[hammer and sickle]].]]In the [[Eastern Bloc]], both ''Animal Farm'' and later ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' were on the list of forbidden books until the end of [[communism]] in 1989, and were only available via clandestine [[Samizdat]] networks.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}}Orwell biographer Jeffrey Meyers has written, &quot;virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory.&quot; Orwell himself wrote in 1946, &quot;Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution..[and] ''that kind'' of revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters [-] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert.&quot;&lt;ref name=OrwellLIL334/&gt; In a preface for a 1947 Ukrainian edition, he stated, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;for the past ten years I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement. On my return from Spain [in 1937] I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Crick, Bernard. ''Orwell, A Life'', p. 450&lt;/ref&gt;The revolt of the animals against Farmer Jones is Orwell's analogy with the [[October Revolution|October 1917 Bolshevik Revolution]], and Jones's attempt to regain control, with the aid of neighbouring farmers, parallels the Western powers' efforts 1918-21 to crush the Bolsheviks. The pigs' rise to pre-eminence mirrors the rise of a Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR, just as Napoleon's emergence as the farm's sole leader reflects Stalin's emergence. The pigs' appropriation of milk and apples for their own use, &quot;the turning point of the story&quot; as Orwell termed it in a letter to [[Dwight Macdonald]],&lt;ref name=OrwellLIL334&gt; Orwell, George. ''A Life in Letters'', Penguin ISBN 978-0-141-19263-5 p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left-wing 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt revolt]] against the Bolsheviks,&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, Letter to Dwight Macdonald, 5 December 1946, ''A Life in Letters'', p.334 Penguin 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plans]]. The puppies controlled by Napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the Stalinist structure, and the pigs' treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;''Orwell Subverted'', 6–7 Daniel Leab, Penn State Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter seven, when the animals confess their nonexistent crimes and are killed, Orwell directly alludes to the purges, confessions and [[Moscow show trials|show trials]] of the late 1930s.

In Paris he met Joseph Czapski, a survivor of the [[Katyn Massacre]]. In spite of Czapski's opposition to the Soviet regime, he told Orwell, as Orwell wrote to [[Arthur Koestler]], that it had been &quot;the character [and] greatness of Stalin&quot; that saved Russia from the German invasion.&lt;ref&gt;A Note on the Text, Peter Davison, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition 1989, p. xx&lt;/ref&gt;The ''Battle of the Cowshed'' represents the allied invasion of the [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]] in 1918,&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Hobley Davison 1996&quot; /&gt; and the defeat of the [[White movement|White Russians]] in the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Edgerly Firchow 2008&quot; /&gt;[[File:XV съезд ВКП(б) - Рыков, Скрыпник, Сталин.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Front row (left to right): [[Alexey Rykov|Rykov]], [[Mykola Skrypnyk|Skrypnyk]], and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]—'When Snowball comes to the crucial points in his speeches he is drowned out by the sheep (Ch.

Both differ from the novel, and have been accused of taking significant liberties, including sanitising some aspects. In the 1954 version, Napoleon is apparently overthrown in a second revolution. The 1999 film shows Napoleon's regime collapsing in on itself, with the farm having new human owners, as happened in the Soviet Union, appropriating the new political reality to the story.

The study of agriculture is known as [[agricultural science]]. The [[history of agriculture]] dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different [[climate]]s, cultures, and technologies. However, all farming generally relies on techniques to expand and maintain the lands that are suitable for raising domesticated species. For plants, this usually requires some form of [[irrigation]], although there are methods of [[dryland farming]]. [[Livestock]] are raised in a combination of grassland-based and landless systems, in an industry that covers almost one-third of the world's ice- and water-free area. In the developed world, [[industrial agriculture]] based on large-scale [[monoculture]] has become the dominant system of modern farming, although there is growing support for [[sustainable agriculture]], including [[permaculture]] and [[organic farming|organic agriculture]].Until the [[Industrial Revolution]], the vast majority of the human population labored in agriculture. Pre-industrial agriculture was typically [[subsistence agriculture]]/ [[self-sufficiency]] in which farmers raised most of their crops for their own consumption instead of [[cash crop]]s for trade. A remarkable shift in agricultural practices has occurred over the past century in response to new technologies, and the development of world markets. This also has led to technological improvements in agricultural techniques, such as the [[Haber-Bosch]] method for synthesizing [[ammonium nitrate]] which made the traditional practice of recycling [[nutrient]]s with [[crop rotation]] and animal [[manure]] less important.Modern [[agronomy]], [[plant breeding]], [[agrochemical]]s such as [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizers]], and technological improvements have sharply increased yields from cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects. [[Selective breeding]] and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about [[animal welfare]] and the health effects of the [[antibiotics]], [[growth hormones]], and other chemicals commonly used in industrial meat production. [[Genetically Modified Organisms]] are an increasing component of agriculture today, although they are banned in several countries. Agricultural food production and water management are targeted as an increasingly global issue that is fostering debate on a number of issues. Significant degradation of land and water resources, including the depletion of [[aquifer]]s, has been observed in recent decades, and the effects of global warming on agriculture and of agriculture on global warming are still not fully understood.The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, [[fuel]]s, and [[raw material]]s. Specific foods include [[cereal]]s (grains), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[cooking oil|oils]], [[meat]] and [[spice]]s. Fibers include [[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], [[silk]] and [[flax]]. Raw materials include [[lumber]] and [[bamboo]]. Other useful materials are produced by plants, such as [[resin]]s, [[natural dye|dyes]], [[drug]]s, [[perfume]], [[biofuel]]s and ornamental products such as [[Floriculture|cut flowers]] and [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery plants]]. Over one third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the services sector, although the percentages of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the past several centuries.==Etymology and terminology==The word ''agriculture'' is a late [[Middle English]] adaptation of Latin ''agricultūra'', from ''ager'', &quot;field&quot;, and ''cultūra'', &quot;[[Tillage|cultivation]]&quot; or &quot;growing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=14|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Word Histories|editor=Chantrell, Glynnis|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-863121-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture usually refers to human activities, although it is also observed in certain species of [[ant]], [[termite]] and [[ambrosia beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626|title=The Evolution of Agriculture in Insects|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=36|pages=563–595|date=December 2005|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626|author=Ulrich G.

Even then, it is acknowledged that there is a large amount of knowledge transfer and overlap between [[silviculture]] (the management of forests) and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=15–16|url=http://books.google.com/?id=VMw9VcLT-FYC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=differences+between+forestry+and+agriculture#v=onepage&amp;q=differences%20between%20forestry%20and%20agriculture&amp;f=false|title=Forestry Research: A Mandate for Change|author=Committee on Forestry Research, National Research Council|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1990|isbn=0309042488}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional farming, the two are often combined even on small landholdings, leading to the term [[agroforestry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80364e/80364E04.htm#Agro-forestry%20and%20forest%20laws,%20policies,%20and%20customs|chapter=Applicability of agro-forestry systems|author=Budowski, Gerardo|publisher=United Nations University|title=Agro-forestry in the African Humid Tropics|editor=MacDonald, L.H.|year=1982|isbn=92-808-0364-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;== History =={{Main|History of agriculture}}{{See also|Timeline of agriculture and food technology}}[[File:ClaySumerianSickle.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Sumer]]ian harvester's sickle made from baked clay (ca. 3000&amp;nbsp;BC)]]Agricultural practices such as [[irrigation]], [[crop rotation]], [[fertilizers]], [[pesticides]] and the [[domestication]] of livestock were developed long ago, but have made great progress in the past century. The [[history of agriculture]] has played a major role in [[history of the world|human history]], as agricultural progress has been a crucial factor in worldwide [[social change|socio-economic change]]. [[Division of labour]] in agricultural societies made commonplace specializations rarely seen in [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures, which allowed the growth of towns and cities, and the complex societies we call [[civilization]]s.  When farmers became capable of producing food beyond the needs of their own families, others in their society were freed to devote themselves to projects other than food acquisition. Historians and anthropologists have long argued that the development of agriculture made civilization possible. The total [[world population]] probably never exceeded 15 million inhabitants before the development of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tellier, Luc-Normand|year=2009|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&amp;pg=&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective|publisher=PUQ|page=26|isbn=2-7605-1588-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jared Diamond]], the costs of agriculture were: &quot;the average daily number of work hours increased, nutrition deteriorated, infectious disease and body wear increased, and lifespan shortened.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The World Until Yesterday|author=Jared Diamond|page=353|isbn=978-0-670-02481-0|publisher=Viking|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;=== Prehistoric origins ===[[Forest gardening]], a plant-based food production system, is thought to be the world's oldest [[agroecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Forest Farms of Kandy: And Other Gardens of Complete Design|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=2003|page=1|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QYBSfUJPQXcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20forest%20farms%20of%20kandy%20and%20other%20gardens%20of%20complete%20design&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-7546-0958-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest gardens originated in [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of [[monsoon]] regions.

Less perishable products, such as grains, preserved foods, olive oil and wine, were often traded over an extensive network of land and sea routes. The ancient trade in agricultural goods was well established, with wine traded in the Mediterranean region in the 6th century BC and Rome receiving extensive shipments of grain as tax payments by the 2nd century BC. Huge amounts of grain were transported, mainly by sea, and it was during this period that the subsidization of grain farming began, for the prevention of famine. Ancient Rome was a major center for agricultural trade.

Tools including the scythe and plow were improved from classical versions, a [[three field system]] of crop rotation was invented, and the [[moldboard plow]] and wheeled plow were increasingly used. [[Draft horse]]s were bred and increasingly used as a [[working animal]] in many parts of Europe, while [[oxen]] continued to be used for this purpose. Metal horseshoes were widely adopted. Much of Europe had low population densities during this period, to which [[extensive farming]] was well-suited. In parts of Southern Europe, more intensive farming combined techniques continued from classical Roman agriculture and those transferred from Islamic regions. In the late Middle Ages, the use of [[manure]] as fertilizer increased, which in turn decreased the necessity of regular fallowing of fields.===Columbian exchange===The history of agriculture in the [[Age of Discovery]] and [[early modern era]] was closely tied to the processes of European exploration and colonization. After 1492 the world's agricultural patterns were shuffled in the widespread exchange of plants and animals known as the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Crops and animals that were previously only known in the Old World were now transplanted to the New and vice versa. Perhaps most notably, the [[tomato]] became a favorite in European cuisine, and [[maize]] and [[potato]]es were widely adopted. Other transplanted crops include [[pineapple]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], and [[tobacco]]. In the other direction, several wheat strains quickly took to western hemisphere soils and became a dietary staple even for native North, Central and South Americans. Agriculture was a key element in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], [[triangular trade]], and the expansion by European powers into the Americas. In the expanding [[plantation economy]], large plantations producing crops including sugar, cotton, and [[indigo dye|indigo]], were heavily dependent upon [[slave labor]].===Modern era==={{Main|British Agricultural Revolution}}{{See also|List of agricultural machinery|Industrial agriculture|Mechanized agriculture}}Use of primitive agricultural techniques was the historical standard. The vast majority of the world population engaged in [[subsistence agriculture]] and yields remained low. Between the 16th century and the mid-19th century, [[Great Britain]] saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output, changes that subsequently affected agriculture around the world. New agricultural practices like [[enclosure]], [[mechanization]], [[four-field crop rotation]] and [[selective breeding]] enabled an unprecedented population growth, freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce, and thereby helped drive the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/handle/2381/1407|title=Zooarchaeology, improvement and the British agricultural revolution|author=Thomas, Richard M.|journal=International Journal of Historical Archaeology|date= June 2005|volume=9|issue=2|pages=71–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century, agricultural practices, particularly careful selection of hardy strains and cultivars, had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the Middle Ages and before.

The population of England in 1750 reached the level of 5.7 million, just as it had done in the past in around 1350 and again in 1650. This time, instead of a [[Malthusian catastrophe]] occurring from plague or famine, the population growth [[Malthusian trap|remained sustained]].[[File:Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt (2).jpg|thumb|left|200x200px|[[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles 'Turnip' Townshend]], agriculturalist who introduced four-field [[crop rotation]] and the cultivation of turnips]]One of the keys to the British Agricultural Revolution was the development of ways of keeping and improving the arable land in Great Britain to counteract the loss of the [[soil]]'s [[plant nutrition|plant nutrients]] in cropping a given area. Higher yielding land was added to higher yielding crops with more yield/acre. Farm workers using more productive tools and machinery produced more crops with fewer workers. The Agricultural Revolution picked up speed as the Industrial Revolution and the advances in chemistry produced the scientific knowledge, wealth and technology for a more systematic development of commercial fertilizers and new and more productive agricultural machinery.Advice on more productive techniques for farming began to appear in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as [[Samuel Hartlib]], [[Walter Blith]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Thirsk|first=Joan|title='Blith, Walter (bap. 1605, d. 1654)'|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008| url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2655|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places [[crop rotation]] was used. A four-field rotation was popularised by the [[United Kingdom|British]] agriculturist [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]] in the 18th century. The system ([[wheat]], [[turnip]]s, [[barley]] and [[clover]]), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing [[livestock]] to be bred year-round. The use of turnip was especially important as the legume roots were an important source of nutrients for the soil.Another catalyst for improvement came from the [[enclosure movement]]. Prior to the 18th century, agriculture across [[Europe]] used the [[feudal]] [[open field system]] with subsistence farmers cropping strips of land in fields held in common and splitting up the produce; this was very inefficient and reduced incentive to improve the productivity. Many farms began to be enclosed by [[yeomen]] who improved the use of their land. This process accelerated in the 15th and 16th centuries with special acts of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to expedite the legal process. This culminated in the [[Enclosure Act|General Enclosure Act]] of 1801, which sanctioned large-scale [[land reform]].[[File:ShireDraftHorse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shire horse|Shires]] [[selective breeding|selectively bred]] for size, in the 18th century]]The mechanisation and rationalisation of agriculture was another important factor. [[Robert Bakewell (farmer)|Robert Bakewell]] and [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester of Holkham|Thomas Coke]] introduced [[selective breeding]], and initiated a process of inbreeding to maximise desirable traits from the mid-18th century, such as the [[New Leicester]] sheep.Machines were invented to improve the efficiency of various agricultural operations, such as [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]]'s [[seed drill]] of 1701 that mechanised seeding at the correct depth and spacing and [[Andrew Meikle]]'s [[threshing machine]] of 1784. Ploughs were steadily improved, from Joseph Foljambe's [[Plough#Heavy ploughs|Rotherham iron plough]] in 1730&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rotherhamweb.co.uk/h/plough.htm The Rotherham Plough]&lt;/ref&gt; to [[James Small (inventor)|James Small]]'s improved &quot;Scots Plough&quot; metal in 1763.

He investigated the impact of inorganic and organic fertilizers on crop yield and founded one of the first artificial fertilizer manufacturing factories in 1842. Fertilizer, in the shape of [[sodium nitrate]] deposits in [[Chile]], was imported to Britain by [[John Thomas North]] as well as [[guano]] (bird droppings). The first commercial process for fertilizer production was the obtaining of ''[[super phosphate|phosphate]]'' from the dissolution of [[coprolite]]s in [[sulphuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;Coprolite Fertilizer Industry in Britain [http://www.pdmhs.com/PDFs/ScannedBulletinArticles/Bulletin%2014-5%20-%20The%20Origins%20and%20Development%20of%20the%20British%20.pdf] Accessed 3 Apr 2012&lt;/ref&gt;The repeal of the [[Corn Law]]s in 1846 that removed [[tariff]]s on food imports, and the development of [[steamship]]s and [[railway]]s, which revolutionised the transportation of food, allowed a truly global market for food to emerge.

Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4101/WPS4864.pdf?sequence=1|title=How Do Agricultural Policy Restrictions to Global Trade and Welfare Differ across Commodities?|author=Peter J.

Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery; and use of gasoline, liquid [[propane]], and electricity to power dryers, pumps, lights, heaters, and coolers. American farms directly consumed about 1.2 exajoules (1.1 quadrillion BTU) in 2002, or just over 1 percent of the nation's total energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Schnepf, Randy|date=19 November 2004|title=Energy use in Agriculture: Background and Issues|work=CRS Report for Congress|url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/RL32677.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;Indirect consumption is mainly oil and [[natural gas]] used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides, which accounted for 0.6 exajoules (0.6 quadrillion BTU) in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;/&gt; The natural gas and coal consumed by the production of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] can account for over half of the agricultural energy usage. China utilizes mostly coal in the production of nitrogen fertilizer, while most of Europe uses large amounts of natural gas and small amounts of coal. According to a 2010 report published by [[The Royal Society]], agriculture is increasingly dependent on the direct and indirect input of fossil fuels. Overall, the fuels used in agriculture vary based on several factors, including crop, production system and location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2991.full|title=Energy and the food system|author=Jeremy Woods, Adrian Williams, John K.

    <text xml:space="preserve">{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}'''Analysis of variance''' ('''ANOVA''') is a collection of [[statistical model]]s used to analyze the differences between group means and their associated procedures (such as &quot;variation&quot; among and between groups). In ANOVA setting, the observed [[variance]] in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a [[statistical test]] of whether or not the [[mean]]s of several groups are equal, and therefore generalizes [[Student's t-test#Independent two-sample t-test|''t''-test]] to more than two groups. Doing multiple two-sample t-tests would result in an increased chance of committing a [[type I error]]. For this reason, ANOVAs are useful in comparing (testing) three or more means (groups or variables) for statistical significance.==Motivating example==[[File:ANOVA no fit.jpg|thumb|No fit at all]][[File:ANOVA fair fit.jpg|thumb|Fair fit]][[File:ANOVA very good fit.jpg|thumb|Very good fit]]The analysis of variance can be used as an exploratory tool to explain observations.  A dog show provides an example.  A dog show is not a random sampling of the breed.  It is typically limited to dogs that are male, adult, pure-bred and exemplary.  A histogram of dog weights from a show might plausibly be rather complex, like the yellow-orange distribution shown in the illustrations.  An attempt to explain the weight distribution by dividing the dog population into groups (young vs old)(short-haired vs long-haired) would probably be a failure (no fit at all). The groups (shown in blue) have a large variance and the means are very close.  An attempt to explain the weight distribution by (pet vs working breed)(less athletic vs more athletic) would probably be somewhat more successful (fair fit).  The heaviest show dogs are likely to be big strong working breeds.  An attempt to explain weight by breed is likely to produce a very good fit.  All Chihuahuas are light and all St Bernards are heavy.  The difference in weights between Setters and Pointers does not justify separate breeds.  The analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments.  A common use of the method is the analysis of experimental data or the development of models.  The method has some advantages over correlation: not all of the data must be numeric and one result of the method is a judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship.==Background and terminology==ANOVA is a particular form of [[statistical hypothesis testing]] heavily used in the analysis of experimental data.  A statistical hypothesis test is a method of making decisions using data.  A test  result (calculated from the [[null hypothesis]] and the sample) is called statistically significant if it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance, ''assuming the truth of the null hypothesis''.  A statistically significant result (when a probability ([[p-value]]) is less than a threshold (significance level)) justifies the rejection of the [[null hypothesis]], but only if the a priori probability of the null hypothesis is not high.In the typical application of ANOVA, the null hypothesis is that all groups are simply random samples of the same population.  This implies that all treatments have the same effect (perhaps none).  Rejecting  the null hypothesis implies that different treatments result in altered effects.By construction, hypothesis testing limits the rateof Type I errors (false positives leading to false scientific claims)to a significance level.  Experimenters also wish to limit Type IIerrors (false negatives resulting in missed scientific discoveries).The Type II error rate is a function of several things includingsample size (positively correlated with experiment cost), significancelevel (when the standard of proof is high, the chances of overlookinga discovery are also high) and effect size (when the effect isobvious to the casual observer, Type II error rates are low).The terminology of ANOVA is largely from the statistical[[design of experiments]].  The experimenter adjusts factors andmeasures responses in an attempt to determine an effect.  Factors areassigned to experimental units by a combination of randomization and[[Randomized block design|blocking]] to ensure the validity of the results.  [[Blind experiment|Blinding]] keeps theweighing impartial.  Responses show a variability that is partiallythe result of the effect and is partially random error.ANOVA is the synthesis of several ideas and it is used for multiplepurposes.  As a consequence, it is difficult to define concisely or precisely.&quot;Classical ANOVA for balanced data does three things at once:# As exploratory data analysis, an ANOVA is an organization of an additive data decomposition, and its sums of squares indicate the variance of each component of the decomposition (or, equivalently, each set of terms of a linear model).# Comparisons of mean squares, along with F-tests&amp;nbsp;... allow testing of a nested sequence of models.# Closely related to the ANOVA is a linear model fit with coefficient estimates and standard errors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gelman (2005, p 2)&lt;/ref&gt;In short, ANOVA is a statistical tool used in several ways to develop and confirm an explanation for the observed data.Additionally:#&lt;li value=&quot;4&quot;&gt; It is computationally elegant and relatively robust against violations of its assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;# ANOVA provides industrial strength (multiple sample comparison) statistical analysis.# It has been adapted to the analysis of a variety of experimental designs.As a result:ANOVA &quot;has long enjoyed the status of being the '''most used''' (some wouldsay abused) statistical technique in psychological research.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, p 320)&lt;/ref&gt;ANOVA &quot;is probably the '''most useful''' technique in the field ofstatistical inference.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, p 63)&lt;/ref&gt;ANOVA is difficult to teach, particularly for complex experiments, with [[Restricted randomization|split-plot designs]] being notorious.&lt;ref&gt;Gelman (2005, p 1)&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases the properapplication of the method is best determined by problem pattern recognitionfollowed by the consultation of a classic authoritative test.&lt;ref&gt;Gelman (2005, p 5)&lt;/ref&gt;===Design-of-experiments terms===(Condensed from the NIST Engineering Statistics handbook: Section 5.7. AGlossary of DOE Terminology.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Section 5.7.

The reason for blocking is to isolate a systematic effect and prevent it from obscuring the main effects. Blocking is achieved by restricting randomization.; Design: A set of experimental runs which allows the fit of a particular model and the estimate of effects.; DOE: Design of experiments.

The effect of a single factor is also called a main effect.; Error: Unexplained variation in a collection of observations. DOE's typically require understanding of both random error and lack of fit error.; Experimental unit: The entity to which a specific treatment combination is applied.; Factors: Process inputs an investigator manipulates to cause a change in the output.; Lack-of-fit error: Error that occurs when the analysis omits one or more important terms or factors from the process model. Including replication in a DOE allows separation of experimental error into its components: lack of fit and random (pure) error.; Model: Mathematical relationship which relates changes in a given response to changes in one or more factors.; Random error: Error that occurs due to natural variation in the process. Random error is typically assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and a constant variance. Random error is also called experimental error.; Randomization: A schedule for allocating treatment material and for conducting treatment combinations in a DOE such that the conditions in one run neither depend on the conditions of the previous run nor predict the conditions in the subsequent runs.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Randomization is a term used in multiple ways in thismaterial.  &quot;Randomization has three roles in applications: as a devicefor eliminating biases, for example from unobserved explanatoryvariables and selection effects: as a basis for estimating standarderrors: and as a foundation for formally exact significance tests.&quot;Cox (2006, page 192)  Hinkelmann and Kempthorne use randomizationboth in experimental design and for statistical analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;; Replication: Performing the same treatment combination more than once. Including replication allows an estimate of the random error independent of any lack of fit error.; Responses: The output(s) of a process. Sometimes called dependent variable(s).; Treatment: A treatment is a specific combination of factor levels whose effect is to be compared with other treatments.==Classes of models==There are three classes of models used in the analysis of variance, and these are outlined here.===Fixed-effects models==={{Main|Fixed effects model}}The fixed-effects model of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see if the [[response variable]] values change. This allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole.===Random-effects models==={{Main|Random effects model}}Random effects models are used when the treatments are not fixed. This occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population. Because the levels themselves are [[random variables]], some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments (a multi-variable generalization of simple differences) differ from the fixed-effects model.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Chapter 12: Experiments with random factors)&lt;/ref&gt;===Mixed-effects models==={{Main|Mixed model}}A mixed-effects model contains experimental factors of both fixed and random-effects types, with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types.Example:Teaching experiments could be performed by a university departmentto find a good introductory textbook, with each text considered atreatment.  The fixed-effects model would compare a list of candidatetexts.  The random-effects model would determine whether importantdifferences exist among a list of randomly selected texts.  Themixed-effects model would compare the (fixed) incumbent texts torandomly selected alternatives.Defining fixed and random effects has proven elusive, with competingdefinitions arguably leading toward a linguistic quagmire.&lt;ref&gt;Gelman (2005, pp 20–21)&lt;/ref&gt;==Assumptions of ANOVA==The analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches, the most common of which uses a [[linear model]] that relates the response to the treatments and blocks. Note that the model is linear in parameters but may be nonlinear across factor levels. Interpretation is easy when data is balanced across factors but much deeper understanding is needed for unbalanced data.===Textbook analysis using a normal distribution===The analysis of variance can be presented in terms of a [[linear model]], which makes the following assumptions about the [[probability distribution]] of the responses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Statistical Methods| last1 = Snedecor | first1 = George W.| last2 = Cochran | first2 = William G.| year = 1967 | edition = 6th | page = 321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cochran &amp; Cox (1992, p 48)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, p 323)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Anderson | first1 = David R.| last2 = Sweeney | first2 = Dennis J.| last3 = Williams | first3 = Thomas A.| title = Statistics for business and economics| publisher = West Pub. Co | location = Minneapolis/St. Paul| year = 1996 | edition = 6th| isbn = 0-314-06378-1 | pages = 452–453}}&lt;/ref&gt;* [[Statistical independence|Independence]] of observations &amp;ndash; this is an assumption of the model that simplifies the statistical analysis.* [[normal distribution|Normality]] &amp;ndash; the distributions of the residuals are [[Normal distribution|normal]].* Equality (or &quot;homogeneity&quot;) of variances, called [[homoscedasticity]] &amp;mdash; the variance of data in groups should be the same.The separate assumptions of the textbook model imply that the [[errors and residuals in statistics|errors]] are independently, identically, and normally distributed for fixed effects models, that is, that the errors (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;'s) are independent and:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \thicksim N(0, \sigma^2).\,&lt;/math&gt;===Randomization-based analysis==={{See also|Random assignment|Randomization test}}In a [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled experiment]], the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units, following the experimental protocol. This randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out. The objective random-assignment is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis, following the ideas of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] and [[Ronald A. Fisher]]. This design-based analysis was discussed and developed by [[Francis J. Anscombe]] at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] and by [[Oscar Kempthorne]] at [[Iowa State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Anscombe (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Kempthorne and his students make an assumption of ''unit treatment additivity'', which is discussed in the books of Kempthorne and [[David R. Cox]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}====Unit-treatment additivity====In its simplest form, the assumption of unit-treatment additivity&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Unit-treatment additivity is simply termed additivityin most texts.  Hinkelmann and Kempthorne add adjectives anddistinguish between additivity in the strict and broad senses.  Thisallows a detailed consideration of multiple error sources (treatment,state, selection, measurement and sampling) on page 161.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the observed response &lt;math&gt;y_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; from experimental unit &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; when receiving treatment &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; can be written as the sum of the unit's response &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; and the treatment-effect &lt;math&gt; t_j&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;ref&gt;Kempthorne (1979, p 30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox&quot;&gt;Cox (1958, Chapter 2: Some Key Assumptions)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Throughout.  Introduced in Section 2.3.3: Principles of experimental design; The linear model; Outline of a model)&lt;/ref&gt;: &lt;math&gt;y_{i,j}=y_i+t_j.&lt;/math&gt;The assumption of unit-treatment additivity implies that, for every treatment &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th treatment have  exactly the same effect &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; on every experiment unit.The assumption of unit treatment additivity  usually cannot be directly [[falsificationism|falsified]], according to Cox and Kempthorne. However, many ''consequences'' of treatment-unit additivity can be falsified. For a randomized experiment, the assumption of unit-treatment additivity ''implies'' that the variance is constant for all treatments. Therefore, by [[contraposition]], a necessary condition for unit-treatment additivity is that the variance is constant.The use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design-based inference that is standard in finite-population [[survey sampling]].====Derived linear model====Kempthorne uses the randomization-distribution and the assumption of ''unit treatment additivity'' to produce a ''derived linear model'', very similar to the textbook model discussed previously.&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.3:Completely Randomized Design; Derived Linear Model)&lt;/ref&gt;  The test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model, according to approximation theorems and simulation studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;HinkelmannKempthorne&quot;&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.6: Completely randomized design; Approximating the randomization test)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are differences. For example, the randomization-based analysis results in a small but (strictly) negative correlation between the observations.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (2008, Chapter 2.14 &quot;A More General Model&quot; in Bailey, pp.&amp;nbsp;38–40)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Chapter 7: Comparison of Treatments)&lt;/ref&gt; In the randomization-based analysis, there is ''no assumption'' of a ''normal'' distribution and certainly ''no assumption'' of ''independence''. On the contrary, ''the observations are dependent''!The randomization-based analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious algebra and extensive time.  Since the randomization-based analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using a normal linear model, most teachers emphasize the normal linear model approach. Few statisticians object to model-based analysis of balanced randomized experiments.====Statistical models for observational data====However, when applied to data from non-randomized experiments or [[observational study|observational studies]], model-based analysis lacks the warrant of randomization.&lt;ref&gt;Kempthorne (1979, pp 125–126,&quot;The experimenter must decide which of the various causes that hefeels will produce variations in his results must be controlledexperimentally.  Those causes that he does not control experimentally,because he is not cognizant of them, he must control by the device ofrandomization.&quot;  &quot;[O]nly when the treatments in the experiment areapplied by the experimenter using the full randomization procedure isthe chain of inductive inference sound.  It is ''only'' under thesecircumstances that the experimenter can attribute whatever effects heobserves to the treatment and the treatment only.  Under thesecircumstances his conclusions are reliable in the statistical sense.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; For observational data, the derivation of confidence intervals must use ''subjective'' models, as emphasized by [[Ronald A. Fisher]] and his followers. In practice, the estimates of treatment-effects from observational studies  generally are often inconsistent.  In practice, &quot;statistical models&quot; and observational data are useful for suggesting hypotheses that should be treated very cautiously by the public.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman {{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Summary of assumptions===The normal-model based ANOVA analysis assumes the independence, normality andhomogeneity of the variances of the residuals. Therandomization-based analysis assumes only the homogeneity of thevariances of the residuals (as a consequence of unit-treatmentadditivity) and uses the randomization procedure of the experiment.Both these analyses require homoscedasticity, as an assumption for the normal-model analysis and as a consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomization-based analysis.However, studies of processes thatchange variances rather than means (called dispersion effects) havebeen successfully conducted using ANOVA.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery(2001, Section 3.8: Discovering dispersion effects)&lt;/ref&gt;  There are''no'' necessary assumptions for ANOVA in its full generality, but theF-test used for ANOVA hypothesis testing has assumptions and practicallimitations which are of continuing interest.Problems which do not satisfy the assumptions of ANOVA can often be transformed to satisfy the assumptions.The property of unit-treatment additivity is not invariant under a &quot;change of scale&quot;, so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit-treatment additivity. If the response variable is expected to follow a parametric family of probability distributions, then the statistician may specify (in the protocol for the experiment or observational study) that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variance.&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.10: Completely randomized design; Transformations)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses, which are believed to follow a multiplicative model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;According to Cauchy's [[functional equation]] theorem, the [[logarithm]] is the only continuous transformation that transforms real multiplication to addition{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}.==Characteristics of ANOVA==ANOVA is used in the analysis of comparative experiments, those inwhich only the difference in outcomes is of interest.  The statisticalsignificance of the experiment is determined by a ratio of twovariances.  This ratio is independent of several possible alterationsto the experimental observations: Adding a constant to allobservations does not alter significance.  Multiplying allobservations by a constant does not alter significance.  So ANOVAstatistical significance results are independent of constant bias andscaling errors as well as the units used in expressing observations.In the era of mechanical calculation it was common tosubtract a constant from all observations (when equivalent todropping leading digits) to simplify data entry.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery(2001, Section 3-3: Experiments with a single factor: The analysis ofvariance; Analysis of the fixed effects model)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cochran &amp; Cox (1992, p 2 example)&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an example of data[[Coding (social sciences)|coding]].==Logic of ANOVA==The calculations of ANOVA can be characterized as computing a numberof means and variances, dividing two variances and comparing the ratioto a handbook value to determine statistical significance.  Calculatinga treatment effect is then trivial, &quot;the effect of any treatment isestimated by taking the difference between the mean of theobservations which receive the treatment and the general mean.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cochran &amp; Cox (1992, p 49)&lt;/ref&gt;===Partitioning of the sum of squares==={{main|Partition of sums of squares}}ANOVA uses traditional standardized terminology.  The definitionalequation of sample variance is&lt;math&gt;s^2=\textstyle\frac{1}{n-1}\sum(y_i-\bar{y})^2&lt;/math&gt;, where thedivisor is called the degrees of freedom (DF), the summation is calledthe sum of squares (SS), the result is called the mean square (MS) andthe squared terms are deviations from the sample mean.  ANOVAestimates 3 sample variances: a total variance based on all theobservation deviations from the grand mean, an error variance based onall the observation deviations from their appropriatetreatment means and a treatment variance.  The treatment variance isbased on the deviations of treatment means from the grand mean, theresult being multiplied by the number of observations in eachtreatment to account for the difference between the variance ofobservations and the variance of means.The fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total [[sum of squares (statistics)|sum of squares]] ''SS'' into components related to the effects used in the model. For example, the model for a simplified ANOVA with one type of treatment at different levels.:&lt;math&gt;SS_\text{Total} = SS_\text{Error} + SS_\text{Treatments}&lt;/math&gt;The number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] ''DF'' can be partitioned in a similar way: one of these components (that for error) specifies a [[chi-squared distribution]] which describes the associated sum of squares, while the same is true for &quot;treatments&quot; if there is no treatment effect.:&lt;math&gt;DF_\text{Total} = DF_\text{Error} + DF_\text{Treatments}&lt;/math&gt;See also [[Lack-of-fit sum of squares]].===The F-test==={{Main|F-test}}The [[F-test]] is used for comparing the factors of the total deviation. For example, in one-way, or single-factor ANOVA, statistical significance is tested for by comparing the F test statistic:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{\text{variance between treatments}}{\text{variance within treatments}}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{MS_\text{Treatments}}{MS_\text{Error}} = {{SS_\text{Treatments} / (I-1)} \over {SS_\text{Error} / (n_T-I)}}&lt;/math&gt;where  ''MS'' is mean square, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;  = number of treatments and&lt;math&gt;n_T&lt;/math&gt; = total number of casesto the [[F-distribution]] with &lt;math&gt;I - 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n_T - I&lt;/math&gt;  degrees of freedom. Using the [[F-distribution]] is a natural candidate because the test statistic is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares each of which follows a scaled [[chi-squared distribution]].The expected value of F is &lt;math&gt;1 + {n \sigma^2_\text{Treatment}} /{\sigma^2_\text{Error}}&lt;/math&gt; (where n is the treatment sample size)which is 1 for no treatment effect.  As values of F increase above 1the evidence is increasingly inconsistent with the null hypothesis.Two apparent experimental methods of increasing F are increasing thesample size and reducing the error variance by tight experimentalcontrols.The textbook method of concluding the hypothesis test is to comparethe observed value of F with the critical value of F determined fromtables.  The critical value of F is a function of the numeratordegrees of freedom, the denominator degrees of freedom and thesignificance level (α).  If F ≥ F&lt;sub&gt;Critical&lt;/sub&gt; (Numerator DF, Denominator DF, α)then reject the null hypothesis.The computer method calculates the probability (p-value) of a value ofF greater than or equal to the observed value.  The null hypothesis isrejected if this probability is less than or equal to the significancelevel (α).  The two methods produce the same result.The ANOVA F-test is known to be nearly optimal in the sense ofminimizing false negative errors for a fixed rate of false positiveerrors (maximizing power for a fixed significance level).  To test the hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect, the [[F-test]]'s p-values closely approximate the [[permutation test]]'s [[p-value]]s: The approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced.&lt;ref name=&quot;HinkelmannKempthorne&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.7: Completely randomized design; CRD with unequal numbers of replications)&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[permutation test]]s characterize [[uniformly most powerful test|tests with maximum power]] against all [[alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]], as observed by Rosenbaum.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Rosenbaum (2002, page 40) cites Section 5.7 (Permutation Tests), Theorem 2.3 (actually Theorem 3, page 184) of [[Erich Leo Lehmann|Lehmann]]'s ''Testing Statistical Hypotheses'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; The ANOVA F–test (of the null-hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect) is recommended as a practical test, because of its robustness against many alternative distributions.&lt;ref&gt;Moore and McCabe (2003, page 763)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The F-test for the comparison of variances has a mixed reputation.  Itis not recommended as a hypothesis test to determine whether two''different'' samples have the same variance.  It is recommended forANOVA where two estimates of the variance of the ''same''sample are compared.  While the F-test is not generally robust againstdepartures from normality, it has been found to be robust in thespecial case of ANOVA.  Citations from Moore &amp; McCabe (2003):&quot;Analysis of variance uses F statistics, but these are notthe same as the F statistic for comparing two population standarddeviations.&quot; (page 554) &quot;The F test and other procedures for inferenceabout variances are so lacking in robustness as to be of little use inpractice.&quot; (page 556)  &quot;[The ANOVA F test] is relatively insensitiveto moderate nonnormality and unequal variances, especially when thesample sizes are similar.&quot; (page 763)  ANOVA assumes homoscedasticity,but it is robust.  The statistical test for homoscedasticity (theF-test) is not robust.  Moore &amp; McCabe recommend a rule of thumb.&lt;/ref&gt;===Extended logic===ANOVA consists of separable parts; partitioning sources of varianceand hypothesis testing can be used individually.  ANOVA is used tosupport other statistical tools.  Regression is first used to fit morecomplex models to data, then ANOVA is used to compare models with theobjective of selecting simple(r) models that adequately describe thedata.  &quot;Such models could be fit without any reference to ANOVA, butANOVA tools could then be used to make some sense of the fitted models,and to test hypotheses about batches of coefficients.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelman&quot;&gt;Gelman (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;[W]e think of the analysis of variance as a way of understanding and structuringmultilevel models—not as an alternative to regression but as a toolfor summarizing complex high-dimensional inferences&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelman&quot; /&gt;==ANOVA for a single factor=={{Main|One-way analysis of variance}}The simplest experiment suitable for ANOVA analysis is the completelyrandomized experiment with a single factor.  More complex experimentswith a single factor involve constraints on randomization and includecompletely randomized blocks and Latin squares (and variants:Graeco-Latin squares, etc.).  The more complex experiments share manyof the complexities of multiple factors.  A relatively completediscussion of the analysis (models, data summaries, ANOVA table) ofthe completely randomized experiment is[[One-way analysis of variance|available]].==ANOVA for multiple factors=={{Main|Two-way analysis of variance}}ANOVA generalizes to the study of the effects of multiple factors.When the experiment includes observations at all combinations oflevels of each factor, it is termed [[Factorial experiment|factorial]].Factorial experimentsare more efficient than a series of single factor experiments and theefficiency grows as the number of factors increases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Montgomery&quot;&gt;Montgomery(2001, Section 5-2: Introduction to factorial designs; The advantagesof factorials)&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, factorial designs are heavily used.The use of ANOVA to study the effects of multiple factors has a complication.  In a 3-way ANOVA with factors x, y and z, the ANOVA model includes terms for the main effects (x, y, z) and terms for [[Interaction (statistics)|interactions]] (xy, xz, yz, xyz).All terms require hypothesis tests.  The proliferation of interaction terms increases the risk that some hypothesis test will produce a false positive by chance. Fortunately, experience says that high order interactions are rare.&lt;ref&gt;Belle (2008, Section 8.4: High-order interactions occur rarely)&lt;/ref&gt;The ability to detect interactions is a major advantage of multiplefactor ANOVA.  Testing one factor at a time hides interactions, butproduces apparently inconsistent experimental results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Montgomery&quot; /&gt;Caution is advised when encountering interactions; Testinteraction terms first and expand the analysis beyond ANOVA ifinteractions are found.  Texts vary in their recommendations regardingthe continuation of the ANOVA procedure after encountering aninteraction.  Interactions complicate the interpretation ofexperimental data.  Neither the calculations of significance nor theestimated treatment effects can be taken at face value.  &quot;Asignificant interaction will often mask the significance of main effects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 5-1: Introduction to factorial designs; Basic definitions and principles)&lt;/ref&gt;  Graphical methods are recommendedto enhance understanding.  Regression is often useful.  A lengthy discussion of interactions is available in Cox (1958).&lt;ref&gt;Cox (1958,Chapter 6: Basic ideas about factorial experiments)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some interactions can be removed (by transformations) while others cannot.A variety of techniques are used with multiple factor ANOVA to reduce expense. One technique used in factorial designs is to minimize replication (possibly no replication with support of [[Tukey's test of additivity|analytical trickery]]) and to combine groups when effects are found to be statistically (or practically) insignificant.  An experiment with many insignificant factors may collapse into one with a few factors supported by many replications.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 5-3.7: Introduction to factorial designs; The two-factor factorial design; One observation per cell)&lt;/ref&gt;==Worked numeric examples==Several fully worked numerical examples are available.  A[[F-test#One-way_ANOVA_example|simple case]] uses one-way (a single factor) analysis.  A [[Two-way analysis of variance|more complex case]] uses two-way (two-factor) analysis.==Associated analysis==Some analysis is required in support of the ''design'' of the experiment while other analysis is performed after changes in the factors are formally found to produce statistically significant changes in the responses.  Because experimentation is iterative, the results of one experiment alter plans for following experiments.===Preparatory analysis=======The number of experimental units====In the design of an experiment, the number of experimental units is planned to satisfy the goals of the experiment. Experimentation is often sequential.Early experiments are often designed to provide mean-unbiased estimates of treatment effects and of experimental error. Later experiments are often designed to test a hypothesis that a treatment effect has an important magnitude; in this case, the number of experimental units is chosen so that the experiment is within budget and has adequate power, among other goals.Reporting sample size analysis is generally required in psychology. &quot;Provide information on sample size and the process that led to sample size decisions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (1999, p 596)&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis, which is written in the experimental protocol before the experiment is conducted, is examined in grant applications and administrative review boards.Besides the power analysis, there are less formal methods for selecting the number of experimental units. These include graphical methods based on limitingthe probability of false negative errors, graphical methods based on an expected variation increase (above the residuals) and methods based on achieving a desired confident interval.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-7: Determining sample size)&lt;/ref&gt;====Power analysis====[[Statistical power|Power analysis]] is often applied in the context of ANOVA in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain ANOVA design, effect size in the population, sample size and significance level. Power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have a reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true.&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Chapter 8: Power)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Section 11.12: Power (in ANOVA))&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Section 13.7: Power analysis for factorial experiments)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and McCabe (2003, pp 778–780)&lt;/ref&gt;====Effect size===={{Main|Effect size}}Several standardized measures of effect have been proposed for ANOVA to summarize the strength of the association between a predictor(s) and the dependent variable (e.g., &amp;eta;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or &amp;fnof;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or the overall standardized difference (&amp;Psi;) of the complete model. Standardized effect-size estimates facilitate comparison of findings across studies and disciplines.  However, while standardized effect sizes are commonly used in much of the professional literature, a non-standardized measure of effect size that has immediately &quot;meaningful&quot; units may be preferable for reporting purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot;&gt;Wilkinson (1999, p 599)&lt;/ref&gt;===Followup analysis===It is always appropriate to carefully consider outliers.  They have a disproportionate impact on statistical conclusions and are often the result of errors.====Model confirmation====It is prudent to verify that the assumptions of ANOVA have been met. Residuals are examined or analyzed to confirm homoscedasticity and gross normality.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-4: Model adequacy checking)&lt;/ref&gt;  Residuals should have the appearance of (zero mean normal distribution) noise when plotted as a function of anything including time andmodeled data values. Trends hint at interactions among factors or among observations.  One rule of thumb: &quot;If the largest standard deviation is less than twice the smallest standard deviation, we can use methods based on the assumption of equal standard deviations and our resultswill still be approximately correct.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and McCabe (2003, p 755, Qualifications to this rule appear in a footnote.)&lt;/ref&gt;====Follow-up tests====A statistically significant effect in ANOVA is often followed up with one or more different follow-up tests. This can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses. Follow-up tests are often distinguished in terms of whether they are planned ([[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]) or [[Post-hoc analysis|post hoc]]. Planned tests are determined before looking at the data and post hoc tests are performed after looking at the data.Often one of the &quot;treatments&quot; is none, so the treatment group can act as a control.  [[Dunnett's test]] (a modification of the t-test) tests whether each of the other treatment groups has the samemean as the control.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-5.8: Experiments with a single factor: The analysis ofvariance; Practical interpretation of results; Comparing means with a control)&lt;/ref&gt;Post hoc tests such as [[Tukey's range test]] most commonly compare every group mean with every other group mean and typically incorporate some method of controlling for Type I errors. Comparisons, which are most commonly planned, can be either simple or compound. Simple comparisons compare one group mean with one other group mean. Compound comparisons typically compare two sets of groups means where one set has two or more groups (e.g., compare average group means of group A, B and C with group D). Comparisons can also look at tests of trend, such as linear and quadratic relationships, when the independent variable involves ordered levels.Following ANOVA with pair-wise multiple-comparison tests has been criticized on several grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 7.5:Comparison of Treatments; Multiple Comparison Procedures)&lt;/ref&gt; There are many such tests (10 in one table) and recommendations regarding their use are vague or conflicting.&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Chapter 12: Multiple comparisons among treatment means)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-5: Practical interpretation of results)&lt;/ref&gt;==Study designs and ANOVAs==There are several types of ANOVA. Many statisticians base ANOVA on the [[experimental design|design of the experiment]],&lt;ref&gt;Cochran &amp; Cox (1957, p 9,&quot;[T]he general rule [is] that the way in which the experiment is conducted determines not only whether inferences can be made, but also the calculations required to make them.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; especially on the protocol that specifies the [[random assignment]] of treatments to subjects; the protocol's description of the assignment mechanism should include a specification of the structure of the treatments and of any [[blocking (statistics)|blocking]]. It is also common to apply ANOVA to observational data using an appropriate statistical model.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}Some popular designs use the following types of ANOVA:*[[One-way ANOVA]] is used to test for differences among two or more [[statistical independence|independent]] groups (means),e.g. different levels of urea application in a crop. Typically, however, the one-way ANOVA is used to test for differences among at least three groups, since the two-group case can be covered by a [[t-test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1093/biomet/6.1.1|noedit}}&lt;/ref&gt; When there are only two means to compare, the [[t-test]] and the ANOVA [[F-test]] are equivalent; the relation between ANOVA and ''t'' is given by ''F''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.*[[Factorial experiment|Factorial]] ANOVA is used when the experimenter wants to study the interaction effects among the treatments.*[[Repeated measures]] ANOVA is used when the same subjects are used for each treatment (e.g., in a [[longitudinal study]]).*[[Multivariate analysis of variance]] (MANOVA) is used when there is more than one [[dependent variable|response variable]].==ANOVA cautions==Balanced experiments (those with an equal sample size for each treatment) are relatively easy to interpret; Unbalancedexperiments offer more complexity.  For single factor (one way) ANOVA, the adjustment for unbalanced data is easy, but the unbalanced analysis lacks both robustness and power.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-3.4: Unbalanced data)&lt;/ref&gt;  For more complex designs the lack of balance leads to further complications. &quot;The orthogonality property of main effects and interactions present in balanced data does not carry over to the unbalanced case. This means that the usual analysis of variance techniques do not apply.Consequently, the analysis of unbalanced factorials is much more difficult than that for balanced designs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 14-2: Unbalanced data in factorial design)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the general case, &quot;The analysis of variance can also be applied to unbalanced data, but then the sums of squares, mean squares, and F-ratios will depend on the order in which the sources of variationare considered.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelman&quot; /&gt;  The simplest techniques for handling unbalanced data restore balance by either throwing out data or by synthesizing missing data.  More complex techniques use regression.ANOVA is (in part) a significance test.  The American Psychological Association holds the view that simply reporting significance is insufficient and that reporting confidence bounds is preferred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot; /&gt;While ANOVA is conservative (in maintaining a significance level) against [[multiple comparisons]] in one dimension, it is not conservative against comparisons in multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (1999, p 600)&lt;/ref&gt;==Generalizations==ANOVA is considered to be a special case of [[linear regression]]&lt;ref&gt;Gelman (2005, p.1) (with qualification in the later text)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3.9: The Regression Approach to the Analysis of Variance)&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn is a special case of the [[general linear model]].&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, p 604)&lt;/ref&gt; All consider the observations to be the sum of a model (fit) and a residual (error) to be minimized.The [[Kruskal&amp;ndash;Wallis test]] and the [[Friedman test]] are [[nonparametric]] tests, which  do not rely on an assumption of normality.&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Chapter 18: Resampling and nonparametric approaches to data)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-10: Nonparametric methods in the analysis of variance)&lt;/ref&gt;==History==While the analysis of variance reached fruition in the 20th century,antecedents extend centuries into the past according to Stigler.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  These include hypothesis testing, the partitioning of sums ofsquares, experimental techniques and the additive model.  [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] wasperforming hypothesis testing in the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, p 134)&lt;/ref&gt;The development of least-squares methods by Laplace and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] circa1800 provided an improved method of combining observations (over theexisting practices of astronomy and geodesy).  It also initiated muchstudy of the contributions to sums of squares.  Laplace soon knew howto estimate a variance from a residual (rather than a total) sum ofsquares.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, p 153)&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1827 Laplace was using leastsquares methods to address ANOVA problems regarding measurements ofatmospheric tides.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, pp&amp;nbsp;154–155)&lt;/ref&gt;Before 1800 astronomers had isolated observational errors resultingfrom reaction times (the &quot;[[personal equation]]&quot;) and had developedmethods of reducing the errors.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, pp&amp;nbsp;240–242)&lt;/ref&gt;  Theexperimental methods used in the study of the personal equation werelater accepted by the emerging field of psychology &lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986,Chapter 7 - Psychophysics as a Counterpoint)&lt;/ref&gt; which developed strong(full factorial) experimental methods to which randomization andblinding were soon added.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, p 253)&lt;/ref&gt;  An eloquentnon-mathematical explanation of the additive effects model wasavailable in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, pp&amp;nbsp;314–315)&lt;/ref&gt;Sir Ronald Fisher introduced the term &quot;variance&quot; and proposed a formal analysis of [[variance]] in a 1918 article ''[[The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance''. Ronald A. Fisher. ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh''. 1918. (volume 52, pages 399–433)&lt;/ref&gt;  His first application of the analysis of variance was published in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;On the &quot;Probable Error&quot; of a Coefficient of Correlation Deduced from a Small Sample. Ronald A. Fisher. Metron, 1: 3-32 (1921)&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of variance became widely known after being included in Fisher's 1925 book ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]''.Randomization models were developed by several researchers.  The first waspublished in Polish by [[Neyman]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffé (1959, p 291, &quot;Randomization models were first formulated byNeyman (1923) for the completely randomized design, by Neyman (1935)for randomized blocks, by Welch (1937) and Pitman (1937) for the Latinsquare under a certain null hypothesis, and by Kempthorne (1952, 1955)and Wilk (1955) for many other designs.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;One of the attributes of ANOVA which ensured its early popularity wascomputational elegance.  The structure of the additive model allowssolution for the additive coefficients by simple algebra rather thanby matrix calculations.  In the era of mechanical calculators thissimplicity was critical.  The determination of statisticalsignificance also required access to tables of the F function whichwere supplied by early statistics texts.==See also=={{Commons category|Analysis of variance}}&lt;div style=&quot;-moz-column-count:3; column-count:3;&quot;&gt;*[[AMOVA]]*[[ANCOVA]]*[[ANORVA]]*[[ANOVA on ranks]]*[[ANOVA-simultaneous component analysis]]*[[Mixed-design analysis of variance]]*[[Multivariate analysis of variance|MANOVA]]*[[One-way analysis of variance]]*[[Two-way analysis of variance]]&lt;/div&gt;==Footnotes=={{reflist|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}==Notes=={{reflist|30em}}==References==* {{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2984159|title=The Validity of Comparative Experiments|authorlink=Francis J.

    <text xml:space="preserve">{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}{{redirect3|Adaptive technology}}{{Disability}}[[File:Hoergeraet analog 050609.jpg|thumb|250px|Hearing aid]]'''Assistive Technology''' is an [[umbrella term]] that includes assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for [[disability|people with disabilities]] and also includes the process used in selecting, locating, and using them. AT promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of interacting with, the [[technology]] needed to accomplish such tasks.== Assistive Technology and Adaptive Technology ==The term Adaptive Technology is often used as the [[synonym]] for Assistive Technology, however, they are different terms. Assistive Technology refers to &quot;any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities,&quot; while Adaptive Technology covers items that are specifically designed for persons with disabilities and would seldom be used by non-disabled persons. In other words, &quot;Assistive Technology is any object or system that increases or maintains the capabilities of people with disabilities,&quot; while Adaptive Technology is &quot;any object or system that is specifically designed for the purpose of increasing or maintaining the capabilities of people with disabilities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tennessee Science Standards | url = http://glencoe.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078901359/594902/AAT_v4.pdf | accessdate = 2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Adaptive Technology is a subset of Assistive Technology. Adaptive Technology often refers specifically to electronic and Information Technology access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Assessing for Adaptive Technology Needs | url = http://dtn.tamu.edu/pdf/pp-assessingAT.ppt | accessdate = 2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Mobility impairment and wheelchairs=={{Main|Wheelchair}}[[File:Pride Jazzy Select power chair 001.JPG|thumb|A typical modern battery powered chair.]]Wheelchairs are devices that can be manually propelled or electrically propelled and that include a seating system and are designed to be a substitute for the normal mobility that most people enjoy. Wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility related [[Activities of Daily Living]] which include feeding, toileting, dressing grooming and bathing. The devices comes in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a joystick or other input devices. Often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers. Wheelchairs are used by people for whom [[walking]] is difficult or impossible due to illness, injury, or disability. People with both sitting and walking disability often need to use a wheelchair or walker.==Mobility impairment and walkers=={{Main|Walker (mobility)|l1=Walker}}A [[walker (mobility)|walker]] or walking frame or Rollator is a tool for disabled people who need additional support to maintain balance or stability while walking. It consists of a frame that is about waist high, approximately twelve inches deep and slightly wider than the user. Walkers are also available in other sizes, such as for children, or for heavy people. Modern walkers are height-adjustable. The front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it. It is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front.&lt;ref&gt;C. Barrué. Personalization and Shared Autonomy in Assistive Technologies. Ph. Thesis. Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;==Personal Emergency Response Systems=={{Main|Personal Emergency Response Systems|Telecare}}[[File:Head-wand.jpg|thumb|This voter with a manual dexterity disability is making choices on a touchscreen with a head dauber.]][[Personal Emergency Response Systems]] (PERS), or [[Telecare]] (UK term), are a particular sort of Assistive Technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer. An example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors, thermometers (for [[hypothermia]] risk), flooding and unlit gas sensors (for people with mild [[dementia]]). Notably, these alerts can be customized to the particular person's risks. When the alert is triggered, a message is sent to a caregiver or contact center who can respond appropriately.==Accessibility software=={{Main|Computer accessibility}}In human–computer interaction, computer accessibility (also known as Accessible computing) refers to the accessibility of a computer system to all people, regardless of disability or severity of impairment, examples include [[Web accessibility]] guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningdisabilities.org.uk/page.cfm?pagecode=ISSIWD Web accessibility guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal, such as a smart card, that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed, text size, etc. to their particular needs. This is useful where users want to access public computer based terminals in Libraries, ATM, Information kiosks etc. The concept is encompassed by the CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/CENTechnicalCommittees/Pages/TCStruc.aspx?param=6205&amp;title=Personal%20identification,%20electronic%20signature%20and%20cards%20and%20their%20related%20systems%20and%20operations CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface]&lt;/ref&gt; This development of this standard has been supported in Europe by [[SNAPI]] and has been successfully incorporated into the [[Lasseo]] specifications, but with limited success due to the lack of interest from public computer terminal suppliers.==Assistive Technology for visual impairment=={{Main|Blindness#Management}}Many people with serious visual impairments live independently, using a wide range of tools and techniques.  Examples of Assistive Technology for visually impairment include the [[Canadian currency tactile feature]], which a system of raised dots in one corner, based on Braille cells but not standard [[Braille]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/accessibility.html Accessibility features - Bank Notes - Bank of Canada]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For general computer use access technology such as [[screen reader]]s, [[screen magnifier]]s and [[refreshable Braille display]]s has been widely taken up along with  standalone reading aids that integrate a scanner, optical character recognition (OCR) software, and speech software in a single machine. These function together without a separate PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = What is an electronic reading aid?| publisher = [http://www.rnib.org.uk/ Royal National Institute of Blind People]| url = http://www.rnib.org.uk/livingwithsightloss/Documents/What%20is%20an%20electronic%20reading%20aid.doc| date = 2009-12-01| accessdate = 2010-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Augmentative and alternative communication=={{Main|Augmentative and alternative communication}}[[File:AAC user using eye gaze.JPG|right|thumb|An AAC user uses number coding on an eye gaze communication board]]'''Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)''' is an umbrella term that encompasses methods of communication for those with impairments or restrictions on the production or comprehension of spoken or written language.&lt;ref name=asha2005&gt;[[#refASHA2005|ASHA (2005)]].&lt;/ref&gt; AAC systems are extremely diverse and depend on the capabilities of the user.

Accessed 2009-08-06.&lt;/ref&gt;==Prosthesis=={{main|Prosthesis}}A '''prosthesis''', '''prosthetic''', or '''prosthetic limb'''  is a device that replaces a missing [[Human body|body]] part. It is part of the field of [[biomechatronics]], the science of using [[Mechanical system|mechanical]] devices with human [[muscle]], [[skeleton]], and [[nervous systems]] to assist or enhance motor control lost by [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[disease]], or [[Congenital disorder|defect]]. Prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury (traumatic) or missing from birth ([[congenital]]) or to supplement defective body parts. Inside the body, [[artificial heart valve]]s are in common use with artificial [[artificial heart|heart]]s and [[artificial lung|lungs]] seeing less common use but under active technology development. Other medical devices and aids that can be considered prosthetics include [[hearing aids]], [[visual prosthesis|artificial eyes]], [[palatal obturator]], [[Adjustable gastric band|gastric bands]], and [[dentures]].Prostheses are specifically ''not'' orthoses, although given certain circumstances a prosthesis might end up performing some or all of the same functionary benefits as an orthosis.  Prostheses are technically the complete finished item.  For instance, a C-Leg knee alone is ''not'' a prosthesis, but only a prosthetic ''component''. The complete prosthesis would consist of the attachment system&amp;nbsp; to the residual limb — usually a &quot;socket&quot;, and all the attachment hardware components all the way down to and including the terminal device. Keep this in mind as nomenclature is often interchanged.It should be noted that the terms &quot;prosthetic&quot; and &quot;orthotic&quot; are adjectives used to describe devices such as a prosthetic knee.  The terms &quot;prosthetics&quot; and &quot;orthotics&quot; are used to describe the respective allied health fields.  The devices themselves are properly referred to as &quot;prostheses&quot; and &quot;orthoses&quot; in the plural and &quot;prosthesis&quot; and &quot;orthosis&quot; in the singular.==Assistive Technology and sports==[[File:NYC Marathon wheelchair.jpg|thumb|A [[New York City Marathon]] competitor uses a racing wheelchair.]]Assistive Technology and sports is an area of technology design that is growing. Assistive Technology is the array of new devices created to  enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play. Assistive Technology may be used in [[adaptive sports]], where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate; or, Assistive Technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind.An increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports, leading to the development of new Assistive Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scherer, Marcia and Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistive Technology devices can be simple, or &quot;low-tech&quot;, or they may use highly advanced technology, with some even using computers. Assistive technology for sports may also be simple, or advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assistive technologies|url=http://www.understandingdisability.org/AssistiveTechnologies|publisher=Spaulding Framingham|accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Assistive Technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to elite Paralympic games. More complex Assistive Technology devices have been developed over time, and as a result, sports for people with disabilities &quot;have changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition-oriented activity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scherer, Marcia and Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|page=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Computer accessibility=={{Main|Computer accessibility}}[[File:Sip-and-puff device.jpg|thumb|This is a [[sip-and-puff]] device which allows a person with substantial disability to make selections and navigate computerized interfaces by controlling inhalations and exhalations.]]One of the largest problems that affect patients with disabilities is discomfort with prosthesis.&lt;ref name=hussein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abdullah|first=Hussein A.|coauthors=Tarry, Cole, , Datta, Rahul., Mittal, Gauri S., Abderrahim, Mohamed|title=Dynamic Biomechanical Model for Assessing and Monitoring Robot-Assisted Upper-Limb Therapy|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development|year=2007|volume=44|issue=1|pages=43–62|doi=10.1682/JRRD.2006.03.0025|pmid=17551857}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A new computer program is used to create the most comfortable and useful prosthetics.

The woodcut shows ''Arithmetica'' instructing an [[algorism|algorist]] and an abacist (inaccurately represented as [[Boethius]] and [[Pythagoras]]). There was keen competition between the two from the introduction of the ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Algebra]]'' into Europe in the 12th century until its triumph in the 16th.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Carl B.; Merzbach, Uta C. (1991); pp. 252-253&lt;/ref&gt;]]The '''abacus''' (''plural'' abaci or abacuses), also called a '''counting frame''', is a calculating tool that was in use centuries before the adoption of the written modern numeral system and is still widely used by merchants, traders and clerks in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and elsewhere. Today, abaci are often constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires, but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal. The user of an abacus is called an ''abacist''.&lt;ref&gt;Gove, Philip Babcock (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;==Etymology==The use of the word ''abacus'' dates before 1387 AD, when a [[Middle English]] work borrowed the word from [[Latin]] to describe a sandboard abacus. The Latin word came from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄβαξ ''abax'' &quot;board strewn with sand or dust used for drawing geometric figures or calculating&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemaeus Gramm., De differentia vocabulorum (= Περὶ διαφορᾶς λέξεων) [Sp.] (e codd. Ottobon. gr. 43 + Vat. gr. 197)Page 392, line 26&lt;ἄβαξ&gt; καὶ &lt;ἀβάκιον&gt; διαφέρει· ἄβαξ μὲν γὰρ λέγεται ἐφ' οὗπαρατιθέασι τὰ πράγματα· ἀβάκιον δὲ ἐφ' οὗ ψηφίζουσιν.&lt;/ref&gt; (the exact shape of the Latin perhaps reflects the [[Genitive case|genitive form]] of the Greek word, ἄβακoς ''abakos''). Greek ἄβαξ itself is probably a borrowing of a [[Northwest Semitic]], perhaps [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], word akin to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''ʾābāq'' (אבק), &quot;dust&quot; (since dust strewn on wooden boards to draw figures in).&lt;ref name=&quot;Etymology&quot;&gt;Huehnergard, John (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred plural of ''abacus'' is a subject of disagreement, with both ''abacuses''&lt;ref name = SOED&gt;Brown, Lesley (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''abaci''&lt;ref name = SOED/&gt; in use.==History=====Mesopotamian===The period 2700–2300 BC saw the first appearance of the [[Sumer]]ian abacus, a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their [[sexagesimal]] number system.&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah, Georges (2001); p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;Some scholars point to a character from the [[Babylon]]ian [[cuneiform]] which may have been derived from a representation of the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;Crump, Thomas (1992); p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; It is the belief of Old Babylonian&lt;ref&gt;Melville, Duncan J. (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; scholars such as Carruccio that Old Babylonians &quot;may have used the abacus for the operations of [[addition]] and [[subtraction]]; however, this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Carruccio, Ettore (2006); p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;===Egyptian===The use of the abacus in [[Ancient Egypt]] is mentioned by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], who writes that the Egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left, opposite in direction to the Greek left-to-right method. Archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters. However, wall depictions of this instrument have not been discovered,&lt;ref name=Smith1&gt;Smith, David Eugene (1958); pp. 157–160&lt;/ref&gt; casting some doubt over the extent to which this instrument was used.{{Or|date=December 2010}}===Persian===During the [[Achaemenid Persian Empire]], around 600 BC the Persians first began to use the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Karen (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanian]] [[Iran]]ian empires, scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions by the countries around them – [[India]], [[China]], and the [[Roman Empire]], when it is thought to be expanded over the other countries.===Greek===The earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the Greek abacus dates to the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah, Georges (2001); p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek abacus was a table of wood or marble, pre-set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations. This Greek abacus saw use in Achaemenid Persia, the Etruscan civilization, Ancient Rome and, until the French Revolution, the Western Christian world.A tablet found on the Greek island [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] in 1846 AD (the [[Salamis Tablet]]), dates back to 300 BC, making it the oldest counting board discovered so far. It is a slab of white marble {{convert|149|cm|0|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|75|cm|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|4.5|cm|0|abbr=on}} thick, on which are 5 groups of markings. In the center of the tablet is a set of 5 parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line, capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the bottom-most horizontal line and the single vertical line. Below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it. Below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines, again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them, but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection; the third, sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line.===Roman==={{Main|Roman abacus}}[[File:RomanAbacusRecon.jpg|right|thumb|Copy of a [[Roman abacus]]]]The normal method of calculation in ancient Rome, as in Greece, was by moving counters on a smooth table. Originally pebbles (''calculi'') were used. Later, and in medieval Europe, [[jeton]]s were manufactured. Marked lines indicated units, fives, tens etc. as in the [[Roman numeral]] system. This system of 'counter casting' continued into the late Roman empire and in medieval Europe, and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Pullan, J. M. (1968); p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[Pope Sylvester II]]'s reintroduction of the abacus with very useful modifications, it became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Nancy Marie (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Nancy Marie (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; This abacus used beads on wires; unlike the traditional roman counting boards; which meant the abacus could be used that much faster.&lt;ref&gt;Huff, Toby E. (1993); p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;Writing in the 1st century BC, Horace refers to the wax abacus, a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus.&lt;ref name=rome&gt;Ifrah, Georges (2001); p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;One example of archaeological evidence of the [[Roman abacus]], shown here in reconstruction, dates to the 1st century AD. It has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each. The groove marked I indicates units, X tens, and so on up to millions. The beads in the shorter grooves denote fives –five units, five tens etc., essentially in a [[bi-quinary coded decimal]] system, obviously related to the [[Roman numerals]]. The short grooves on the right may have been used for marking Roman &quot;ounces&quot; (i.e. fractions).===Chinese==={{Main|Suanpan}}[[File:abacus 6.png|thumb|[[Suanpan]] (the number represented in the picture is 6,302,715,408)]]The earliest known written documentation of the Chinese abacus dates to the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah, Georges (2001); p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;The Chinese abacus, known as the ''suànpán'' (算盤, lit. &quot;Counting tray&quot;), is typically {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator. It usually has more than seven rods. There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom for both [[decimal]] and [[hexadecimal]] computation. The beads are usually rounded and made of a [[hardwood]]. The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam. If you move them toward the beam, you count their value. If you move away, you don't count their value.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryerson&quot;&gt;Fernandes, Luis (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The suanpan can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick jerk along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center.&lt;ref&gt;Githens, Perry (1948)&lt;/ref&gt;Suanpans can be used for functions other than counting. Unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools, very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cube root]] operations at high speed. There are currently schools teaching students how to use it.In the famous long scroll ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' painted by [[Zhang Zeduan]] (1085–1145 AD) during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1297 AD), a suanpan is clearly seen lying beside an account book and doctor's prescriptions on the counter of an [[apothecary]]'s (Feibao).The similarity of the [[Roman abacus]] to the Chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other, as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the [[Roman Empire]] and China. However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the similarity of the abaci may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model (like most modern [[#Japanese abacus|Japanese]]) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the standard suanpan has 5 plus 2. (Incidentally, this allows use with a [[hexadecimal]] numeral system.) Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese and Japanese models, the beads of Roman model run in grooves, presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.Another possible source of the suanpan is Chinese [[counting rods]], which operated with a [[decimal|decimal system]] but lacked the concept of [[0 (number)|zero]] as a place holder. The zero was probably introduced to the Chinese in the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907 AD) when travel in the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Middle East]] would have provided direct contact with [[India]], allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the [[decimal point]] from Indian merchants and mathematicians.===Indian===First century sources, such as the ''[[Abhidharmakosa]]'' describe the knowledge and use of abacus in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, Peter N.; Langer, William Leonard (2001); p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Around the 5th century, Indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the Abacus.&lt;ref&gt;Körner, Thomas William (1996); p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu texts used the term ''shunya'' (zero) to indicate the empty column on the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;Mollin, Richard Anthony (1998); p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;===Japanese==={{Main|Soroban}}[[File:Soroban.JPG|thumb|Japanese [[soroban]]]]In Japanese, the abacus is called ''[[soroban]]'' ({{lang|ja|算盤, そろばん}}, lit. &quot;Counting tray&quot;), imported from China around 1600.&lt;ref name=&quot;fernandes&quot;&gt;Fernandes, Luis (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1/4 abacus, which is suited to decimal calculation, appeared circa 1930, and became widespread as the Japanese abandoned hexadecimal weight calculation which was still common in China. The abacus is still manufactured in Japan today even with the proliferation, practicality, and affordability of pocket [[electronic calculator]]s. The use of the soroban is still taught in Japanese [[primary school]]s as part of [[mathematics]], primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation. Using visual imagery of a soroban, one can arrive at the answer in the same time as, or even faster than, is possible with a physical instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Geoffrey (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;===Korean===The Chinese abacus migrated from China to [[Korea]] around 1400 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp&quot;&gt;thocp.net (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Koreans call it ''jupan'' (주판), ''supan'' (수판) or ''jusan'' (주산).&lt;ref&gt;100.daum.net (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;===Native American===[[File:Quipu.png|thumb|Representation of an [[Inca]] [[quipu]]]][[File:Yupana 1.GIF|thumb|A [[yupana]] as used by the Incas.]]Some sources mention the use of an abacus called a ''nepohualtzintzin'' in ancient [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] culture. This Mesoamerican abacus used a 5-digit base-20 system.&lt;ref&gt;inaoep.mx (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;The word Nepōhualtzintzin {{IPA-nah|nepoːwaɬˈt͡sint͡sin|}} comes from the Nahuatl and it is formed by the roots; Ne - personal -; pōhual or pōhualli {{IPA-nah|ˈpoːwalːi|}} - the account -; and tzintzin {{IPA-nah|ˈt͡sint͡sin|}} - small similar elements. And its complete meaning was taken as: counting with small similar elements by somebody. Its use was taught in the ''Calmecac'' {{IPA-nah|kalˈmekak|}} to the ''temalpouhqueh'' {{IPA-nah|temaɬˈpoʍkeʔ|}}, who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies, from childhood. Unfortunately the Nepōhualtzintzin and its teaching were among the victims of the conquering destruction, when a diabolic origin was attributed to them after observing the tremendous properties of representation, precision and speed of calculations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}This arithmetic tool was based on the [[vigesimal]] system (base 20).&lt;ref&gt;tux.org (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; For the Aztec the count by 20s was completely natural. The amount of 4, 5, 13, 20 and other cyclees meant cycles.{{clarify|date=January 2011}} The Nepōhualtzintzin was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord. In the left part there were four beads, which in the first row have unitary values (1, 2, 3, and 4), and in the right side there are three beads with values of 5, 10, and 15 respectively. In order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows, it is enough to multiply by 20 (by each row), the value of the corresponding account in the first row.Altogether, there were 13 rows with 7 beads in each one, which made up 91 beads in each Nepōhualtzintzin. This was a basic number to understand, 7 times 13, a close relation conceived between natural phenomena, the underworld and the cycles of the heavens. One Nepōhualtzintzin (91) represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts, two Nepōhualtzitzin (182) is the number of days of the corn's cycle, from its sowing to its harvest, three Nepōhualtzintzin (273) is the number of days of a baby's gestation, and four Nepōhualtzintzin (364) completed a cycle and approximate a year (1{{fraction|1|4}} days short). The Nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in floating point, which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision, meant that no round off was allowed, when translated into modern computer arithmetic.The rediscovery of the Nepōhualtzintzin was due to the Mexican engineer David Esparza Hidalgo,&lt;ref&gt;Hidalgo, David Esparza (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; who in his wanderings throughout Mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold, jade, encrustations of shell, etc. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. There have also been found very old Nepōhualtzintzin attributed to the [[Olmec]]a culture, and even some bracelets of Mayan origin, as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures.George I. Sanchez, &quot;Arithmetic in Maya&quot;, Austin-Texas, 1961 found another base 5, base 4 abacus in the Yucatán that also computed calendar data. This was a finger abacus, on one hand 0 1,2, 3, and 4 were used; and on the other hand used 0, 1, 2 and 3 were used. Note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles. Sanchez worked with [[Sylvanus Morley]], a noted Mayanist.The [[quipu]] of the [[Inca]]s was a system of knotted cords used to record numerical data, like advanced [[tally stick]]s – but not used to perform calculations. Calculations were carried out using a [[yupana]] ([[Quechua languages|Quechua]] for &quot;counting tool&quot;; see figure) which was still in use after the conquest of Peru. The working principle of a yupana is unknown, but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by Italian mathematician Nicolino De Pasquale. By comparing the form of several yupanas, researchers found that calculations were based using the [[Fibonacci sequence]] 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and powers of 10, 20 and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument. Using the Fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Aimi, Antonio; De Pasquale, Nicolino (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;===Russian===[[File:Schoty abacus.jpg|thumb|Russian abacus]]The Russian abacus, the ''schoty'' (счёты), usually has a single slanted deck, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire, usually positioned near the user, with four beads for quarter-ruble fractions). Older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks, which were minted until 1916. The Russian abacus is often used vertically, with wires from left to right in the manner of a book. The wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center, to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides. It is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right. During manipulation, beads are moved to the left. For easy viewing, the middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th and 6th bead) usually are of a different colour from the other eight beads. Likewise, the left bead of the thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) may have a different color.As a simple, cheap and reliable device, the Russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|former Soviet Union]], and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Bud, Robert; Warner, Deborah Jean (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hudgins, Sharon (2004); p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Even the 1874 invention of [[mechanical calculator]], [[Odhner Arithmometer|Odhner arithmometer]], had not replaced them in [[Russia]] and likewise the mass production of Felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Leushina, A. M. (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of [[Pocket calculator|microcalculators]] had started in the Soviet Union in 1974. Today it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld calculator.The Russian abacus was brought to France around 1820 by the mathematician [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]], who served in [[Napoleon]]'s army and had been a prisoner of war in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Trogemann, Georg; Ernst, Wolfgang (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The abacus had fallen out of use in western Europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and [[algorism]]ic methods. To Poncelet's French contemporaries, it was something new. Poncelet used it, not for any applied purpose, but as a teaching and demonstration aid.&lt;ref&gt;Flegg, Graham (1983); p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;==School abacus==[[File:Kugleramme.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Early 19th century abacus used in Danish elementary school.]]Around the world, abaci have been used in pre-schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the [[numeral system]] and [[arithmetic]].In Western countries, a '''bead frame''' similar to the Russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame has been common (see image). It is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy.The type of abacus shown here is often used to represent numbers without the use of place value. Each bead and each wire has the same value and used in this way it can represent numbers up to 100.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}{{Clear}}==Renaissance abaci gallery==&lt;gallery&gt;File:Gregor Reisch, Margarita Philosophica, 1508 (1230x1615).pngFile:Rechentisch.pngFile:Rechnung auff der Linihen und Federn.JPGFile:Köbel Böschenteyn 1514.jpgFile:Rechnung auff der linihen 1525 Adam Ries.PNGFile:1543 Robert Recorde.PNGFile:Peter Apian 1544.PNGFile:Adam riesen.jpgFile:Rekenaar 1553.jpg&lt;/gallery&gt;==Uses by the blind==An adapted abacus, invented by Tim Cranmer, called a '''Cranmer abacus''' is still commonly used by individuals who are [[blindness|blind]]. A piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they do not move inadvertently. This keeps the beads in place while the users feel or manipulate them. They use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cubic root]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aph&quot;&gt;Terlau, Terrie; Gissoni, Fred (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;Although blind students have benefited from talking calculators, the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades, both in public schools and state schools for the blind. The abacus teaches mathematical skills that can never be replaced with talking calculators and is an important learning tool for blind students.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a braille-writer and [[Nemeth Braille|Nemeth code]] (a type of braille code for mathematics) but large multiplication and long division problems can be long and difficult. The abacus gives blind and visually impaired students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper.
