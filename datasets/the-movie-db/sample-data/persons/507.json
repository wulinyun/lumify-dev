Wells' War of the Worlds.\nFriedman also publishes the blog \"I Find Your Lack of Faith Disturbing\". After being offered an opportunity to work on a script titled Snakes on a Plane, Friedman posted a blog entry that sparked interest in the film on the Internet before the movie entered production. The same entry introduced a profane line that was added to the film when the cast reconvened in March 2006 to shoot additional footage.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Josh Friedman, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",
