# Build Instructions

In the majority of cases, most Lumify components can be built by simply opening a terminal to the component root
directory and running `mvn package`. The two most common components that are a little less straight-forward are the
web application and yarn ingest components. Additional instructions for both can be found below.

## YARN Plugin Build Instructions

Each yarn ingestion plugin can be build independently using the following Maven command.

```Shell
mvn package -pl <path_to_plugin_dir> -am
```

Once the plugin JAR file is created, copy it to the `/lumify/libcache` directory in HDFS.

```Shell
hadoop fs -put <path_to_plugin_jar> /lumify/libcache
```

As an example, to build and deploy the `tika-mime-type-plugin` one would run the following commands from the root of
the Lumify project.

```Shell
mvn package -pl graph-property-worker/plugins/tika-mime-type -am
hadoop fs -put graph-property-worker/plugins/tika-mime-type/target/lumify-tika-mime-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar /lumify/libcache
```

Lumify's yarn topology will automatically detect the plugin in the classpath.

## Web Application Build Instructions

From the root directory of the Lumify project, run

```Shell
mvn package -P web-war -pl web/war -am -DskipTests -Dsource.skip=true
```

The previous command will create a WAR file in the `web/war/target` directory.

<a name="web-plugin"/>
## Web Application Plugin Build Instructions

The Lumify web application can be extended with dynamically loaded plugins. You can find some example plugins in
`web/plugins`. To build a web plugin, run `mvn package -pl ./web/plugins/<plugin-name>/ -am -DskipTests`.

Once the plugin JAR file is created, copy it to the `/lumify/libcache` directory in HDFS
`hadoop fs -put <path_to_plugin_jar> /lumify/libcache`. Or, copy it to the web server's lib directory
`/opt/lumify/lib` or for docker `docker/lumify-dev-persistent/opt/lumify/lib`.

This is the easiest way to expose the plugin to all web servers. The Lumify web application will automatically
add the JAR file to the classpath.
