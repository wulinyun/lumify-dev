# Developer Guide

This guide is intended for those who wish to:

* Contribute code to Lumify
* Create their own Lumify plugins
* Create a custom build of Lumify

In order to work with Lumify as a developer, it's recommended that:

* You know Java, since the entire backend is written in Java.
* You know JavaScript, as the UI is very JavaScript heavy.
* You're familiar with common big data tools, including the Hadoop stack, Accumulo.

If that sounds like you, then continue reading to get started.

## Section 1: Get the [Source Code](source-code.md)

and a little about the source code structure.
