# Architecture Overview

While Lumify leverages a lot of great open source software, its own code is consolidated around two components: the
ingestion pipeline and the web application. The sections below describe all of this in more detail.

## Software Stack

The diagram below shows the major software components used by Lumify. Lumify-specific code is written against many of
these layers, but is not shown in the diagram. There are numerous other libraries not listed. Take a look at the parent
[POM file](../pom.xml) or run `mvn dependency:tree` to get a feel for all the libraries involved.

## Ingestion Pipeline

The ingestion pipeline is primarily implemented using Apache YARN, although you can also ingest data using map reduce.
Instances of both approaches can be found in the Lumify code base.

### YARN-based Ingestion

YARN-based ingestion within Lumify works on top of an abstraction called `GraphPropertyWorker`(s). The abstraction
works a lot like data binding within GUI programming toolkits, with changes to properties of vertices in the graph
being published to a queue. All `GraphPropertyWorker`s are then given an opportunity to inspect the property change and
optionally perform some kind of action, possibly publishing new property changes to the queue for other workers to
process further.

Lumify-provided `GraphPropertyWorker` implementations are found in the `lumify-graph-property-worker-plugins-group` module.
Each is implemented as a plugin and will automatically run if found in the classpath. Please see
the [yarn features](features.md) page for more information about each plugin.

### Map Reduce Ingestion

Map reduce is a more appropriate programming model for batch ingestion of large datasets. Lumify doesn't currently
provide any batch ingestion abstraction similar to what's provided for yarn-based ingestion. You can see several map
reduce ingestion examples in the datasets directory. The most important thing to remember about those examples
is that they require running a re-indexing map reduce job after ingestion.

## Web Application

The Lumify web application backend is written in Java while the front-end is JavaScript and CSS, basically the same
technologies used by many other web applications. It's implemented as a single-page web application utilizing both
AJAX calls and persistent web-socket connections (using Atmosphere) to exchange data.
