# Lumify Repository Config Guide

This guide provides recommended repository configuration and workflow steps for contributing to Lumify.

Lumify uses a modified [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching strategy. Instead of directly merging changes from `feature` and `hotfix` branches back into `develop` or `master`, changes are pushed to a personal fork and submitted for inclusion in the target branch via pull request. Once pull requests are accepted, personal branches can be safely removed and changes can be pulled to local repositories from the upstream, public repo.

## Repository Configuration

The recommeneded repository setup is tracking the `develop` and `master` branches from [`lumifyio/lumify`](https://github.com/lumifyio/lumify), branching off the appropriate source for a feature or hotfix to complete development and pushing that feature/hotfix branch to your personal fork to submit a pull request.

1.	Fork [lumify](https://github.com/lumifyio/lumify), creating `$username/lumify`.

2. Clone the lumifyio/lumify repository. This will make lumifyio/lumify the `origin` remote by default.

	```
	git clone ssh://git@github.com/lumifyio/lumify
	```
	
3.	Add your fork as a remote.

	```
	cd lumify
	git remote add $username ssh://git@github.com/$username/lumify
	```
	
Your local repository should now be on the `develop` branch, tracking `origin/develop` and have two remotes:

-	origin: lumifyio/lumify (public)
- 	$username: $username/lumify (personal fork)

You can check your remotes with `git remote -v`, which should return output similar to:

```
$username		ssh://git@github.com/$username/lumify (fetch)
$username		ssh://git@github.com/$username/lumify (push)
origin			ssh://git@github.com/lumifyio/lumify (fetch)
origin			ssh://git@github.com/lumifyio/lumify (push)
```

## Development Workflow

Most development will be considered a git-flow feature. Feature branches should be named for their JIRA issue number: `feature/LUM-123`. All features should be branched from `develop`.

```
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/LUM-123
```

Once you've completed your patch, push the feature to your private copy.

```
git push -u $username feature/LUM-123
```

Then submit a pull request on GitHub to merge your feature branch into the public `develop` branch.

## Keeping Up to Date

You can keep your local `develop` and/or `master` branches synchronized with the public
repository with simple `pull` commands since they are tracking the corresponding branches
on `lumifyio/lumify`.

```
git checkout develop
git pull

git checkout master
git pull
```

This is also the recommended way to integrate your changes in the local repository once your
pull request has been accepted.

If you want to synchronize the develop and master branches in your fork, you can use the following commands:

```
git checkout develop
git push $username develop

git checkout master
git push $username master
```

**Note there is no `-u` parameter in the push because we don't want to change the upstream tracking.**
